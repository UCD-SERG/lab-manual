When a journal asks for revisions,
you will typically need to provide a point-by-point response to the reviewers' comments.
The key strategy is to use the ["yes-and" approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and_...)
from improvisational theater—building on what reviewers say
rather than contradicting them.
Try to avoid explicitly disagreeing with reviewers if at all possible.

**Standard response format:**

The typical response follows this pattern:

> "Thank you for raising this important point. We agree, and now state (page ##):
>
> [quote a section of the revised manuscript here]"

**Balancing direct response and manuscript content:**

There can be some overlap between the direct response to the reviewer
(the sentences before "now state")
and what goes into the revised manuscript
(the part after "(page ##)").
This is acceptable,
but we usually try to put as much of the content into the revised manuscript as possible,
and minimize the direct response section.
The goal is to make the manuscript self-contained
while showing the reviewer that you've addressed their concern.

**When content already exists:**

Sometimes,
a reviewer asks for content that was already in the manuscript.
In these cases,
first see if there's anything you can elaborate or clarify.
Even if you don't see room for improvement,
you can usually respond with:

> "We agree, and now state (page ##):
>
> [quote the content that was already there before]"

This response isn't false—it's just a bit misleading,
and hopefully counts as a
["white lie"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#White_lie)
made to spare the reviewer's pride.
It acknowledges their input while avoiding the awkwardness
of pointing out that they missed something during their review.

**Additional tips:**

- Always thank reviewers for their time and feedback
- Quote page numbers from the revised manuscript
- Use direct quotes from your revised text when possible
- Maintain a respectful and collaborative tone throughout
- If you make changes beyond what the reviewer requested, mention them briefly
