    "text": "1.1 About the lab\nWelcome to the Seroepidemiology Research Group (SeRG) at the University of California, Davis, led by Drs. Kristen Aiemjoy and Ezra Morrison. Accurate methods to measure infectious disease burden are essential for guiding public health decisions, yet many infectious diseases remain under-recognized due to limited diagnostics and costly, resource-intensive surveillance systems. Our work addresses this gap by developing seroepidemiologic methods to characterize infection burden in populations. Currently, we focus on enteric fever (Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi), Scrub Typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), Melioidosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei), Shigella (Shigella spp.), and Cholera (Vibrio cholerae). We are supported by the US National Institutes of Health, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Department of Defense, and collaborate with partners around the world.

Researchers found that it was not possible to reproduce estimates from published studies: 1) with the same data and same or similar code and 2) with newly collected data using the same (or similar) study design. These “failures” of reproducibility were frequent enough and broad enough in scope, occurring across a range of disciplines (epidemiology, psychology, economics, and others) to be deeply troubling. Program and policy decisions based on erroneous research findings could lead to wasted resources, and at worst, could harm intended beneficiaries. This crisis has motivated new practices in reproducibility, transparency, and openness. Our lab is committed to adopting these best practices, and much of the remainder of the lab manual focuses on how to do so.\nRecommended readings on the “reproducibility crisis”:",

If you need to keep the analysis code private, use a private repository.\nBest practices for analyses with restricted data:\n\nDocument data requirements: Include a README.md in inst/analyses/ explaining:\n\nWhat data is required\nWhere to obtain it (if permissible)\nData access restrictions\nHow to set up data paths\n\nUse relative paths carefully: Structure your code so data paths can be configured:\n\n# In inst/analyses/01-analysis.qmd\n# Users should set this based on their local setup\ndata_dir &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"MYPROJECT_DATA\", \n                       default = \"~/restricted_data/myproject\")\nraw_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(file.path(data_dir, \"sensitive.csv\"))\n\nCreate public alternatives: When possible, create companion vignettes in vignettes/ using:\n\nSimulated data that mimics the structure\nPublicly available datasets\nAggregated/de-identified summaries\n\nAdd to .Rbuildignore: Ensure inst/analyses/ doesn’t cause package checks to fail:\n\n# Use usethis to add to .Rbuildignore\nusethis::use_build_ignore(\"inst/analyses\")\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Keep Analysis Workbooks Tidy\nDecompose reusable functions from your analysis notebooks into the R/ directory. Your vignettes should:\n\nBe clean, readable narratives of your analysis\nCall well-documented functions from your package\nFocus on the “what” and “why” rather than implementation details\nBe reproducible by others with a single click (or with documented data access for private analyses)\n\nExample of what NOT to do (all code in vignette):\n# Bad: 100 lines of data manipulation in vignette\nraw_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n# ... 100 lines of cleaning, transforming, reshaping ...\ncleaned_data &lt;- final_result\nExample of what TO do (functions in R/, simple calls in vignette):\n# Good: Clean vignette calling documented functions\nraw_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data.csv\")\ncleaned_data &lt;- prep_study_data(raw_data)  # Function in R/data_prep.R\n\n\n5.1.5 Shell Scripts and Automation\nShell scripts are useful for automating workflows and ensuring reproducibility. Place shell scripts in data-raw/ alongside the R scripts they coordinate:\ndata-raw/\n├── 0-prep-data.sh          # Shell script to run all data prep\n├── 01-load-survey.R\n├── 02-clean-survey.R\n├── 03-merge-datasets.R\n└── 04-create-analysis-data.R\nUsing shell scripts:\n# data-raw/0-prep-data.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nRscript data-raw/01-load-survey.R\nRscript data-raw/02-clean-survey.R\nRscript data-raw/03-merge-datasets.R\nRscript data-raw/04-create-analysis-data.R\nThis is especially useful when data upstream changes — you can simply run the shell script to reproduce everything. After running shell scripts, .Rout log files will be generated for each script. It is important to check these files to ensure everything has run correctly.\n\n\n5.1.6 Storing Analysis Outputs\nResults files (.RDS): Save analysis results in inst/extdata/:\n# Save results\nreadr::write_rds(analysis_results, here(\"inst\", \"extdata\", \"analysis_results.rds\"))\n\n# Load results later\nresults &lt;- readr::read_rds(here(\"inst\", \"extdata\", \"analysis_results.rds\"))\nFigures and tables: Save publication outputs in inst/output/:\n# Save figure\nggsave(here(\"inst\", \"output\", \"figures\", \"fig1_incidence_trends.pdf\"), \n       width = 8, height = 6)\n\n# Save table\nreadr::write_csv(summary_table, \n                 here(\"inst\", \"output\", \"tables\", \"table1_demographics.csv\"))\nOrganization:\ninst/\n├── extdata/\n│   ├── analysis_results.rds\n│   ├── model_fits.rds\n│   └── processed_data.rds\n└── output/\n    ├── figures/\n    │   ├── fig1_incidence_trends.pdf\n    │   ├── fig2_risk_factors.png\n    │   └── figS1_sensitivity.pdf\n    └── tables/\n        ├── table1_demographics.csv\n        ├── table2_main_results.xlsx\n        └── tableS1_detailed_results.csv",

    "section": "5.3 Organizing the data-raw folder",
    "text": "5.3 Organizing the data-raw folder\nThe data-raw folder serves as a catch-all for scripts that do not (yet) fit into the package structure described above. The data-raw folder should still be organized. We recommend the following subdirectory structure for data-raw:\n0-run-project.sh\n0-config.R\n1 - Data-Management/\n    0-prep-data.sh\n    1-prep-cdph-fluseas.R\n    2a-prep-absentee.R\n    2b-prep-absentee-weighted.R\n    3a-prep-absentee-adj.R\n    3b-prep-absentee-adj-weighted.R\n2 - Analysis/\n    0-run-analysis.sh\n    1 - Absentee-Mean/\n        1-absentee-mean-primary.R\n        2-absentee-mean-negative-control.R\n        3-absentee-mean-CDC.R\n        4-absentee-mean-peakwk.R\n        5-absentee-mean-cdph2.R\n        6-absentee-mean-cdph3.R\n    2 - Absentee-Positivity-Check/\n    3 - Absentee-P1/\n    4 - Absentee-P2/\n3 - Figures/\n    0-run-figures.sh\n    ...\n4 - Tables/\n    0-run-tables.sh\n    ...\n5 - Results/\n    1 - Absentee-Mean/\n        1-absentee-mean-primary.RDS\n        2-absentee-mean-negative-control.RDS\n        3-absentee-mean-CDC.RDS\n        4-absentee-mean-peakwk.RDS\n        5-absentee-mean-cdph2.RDS\n        6-absentee-mean-cdph3.RDS\n    ...\n.gitignore\nFor brevity, not every directory is “expanded”, but we can glean some important takeaways from what we do see.\n\n5.3.1 Configuration (‘config’) File\nThis is the single most important file for your project. It will be responsible for a variety of common tasks, declare global variables, load functions, declare paths, and more. Every other file in the project will begin with source(\"0-config\"), and its role is to reduce redundancy and create an abstraction layer that allows you to make changes in one place (0-config.R) rather than 5 different files. To this end, paths which will be reference in multiple scripts (i.e. a merged_data_path) can be declared in 0-config.R and simply referred to by its variable name in scripts. If you ever want to change things, rename them, or even switch from a downsample to the full data, all you would then to need to do is modify the path in one place and the change will automatically update throughout your project. See the example config file for more details. The paths defined in the 0-config.R file assume that users have opened the .Rproj file, which sets the directory to the top level of the project.\n\n\n5.3.2 Order Files and Directories\nThis makes the jumble of alphabetized filenames much more coherent and places similar code and files next to one another. This also helps us understand how data flows from start to finish and allows us to easily map a script to its output (i.e. 2 - Analysis/1 - Absentee-Mean/1-absentee-mean-primary.R =&gt; 5 - Results/1 - Absentee-Mean/1-absentee-mean-primary.RDS). If you take nothing else away from this guide, this is the single most helpful suggestion to make your workflow more coherent. Often the particular order of files will be in flux until an analysis is close to completion. At that time it is important to review file order and naming and reproduce everything prior to drafting a manuscript.\n\n\n5.3.3 Using Bash scripts to ensure reproducibility\nBash scripts are useful components of a reproducible workflow. At many of the directory levels (i.e. in 3 - Analysis), there is a bash script that runs each of the analysis scripts. This is exceptionally useful when data “upstream” changes – you simply run the bash script. See Chapter 11 for further details.\nAfter running bash scripts, .Rout log files will be generated for each script that has been executed. It is important to check these files. Scripts may appear to have run correctly in the terminal, but checking the log files is the only way to ensure that everything has run completely.",

Very generally, you want to:\n\n1. describe the work completed in the script in a comment header\n2. source your configuration file (`0-config.R`) \n3. load all your data \n4. do all your analysis/computation \n5. save your data. \n\nEach of these sections should be \"chunked together\" using comments. See [this file](https://github.com/kmishra9/Flu-Absenteeism/blob/master/Master's%20Thesis%20-%20Spatial%20Epidemiology%20of%20Influenza/2a%20-%20Statistical-Inputs.R) for a good example of how to cleanly organize a file in a way that follows this \"flow\" and functionally separate pieces of code that are doing different things.\n\n\n\n## Testing Requirements {#sec-r-testing}\n\n**ALWAYS establish tests BEFORE modifying functions.** This ensures changes preserve existing behavior and new behavior is correctly validated.\n\n### When to Use Snapshot Tests\n\nUse snapshot tests (`expect_snapshot()`, `expect_snapshot_value()`) when:\n\n- Testing complex data structures (data frames, lists, model outputs)\n- Validating statistical results where exact values may vary slightly\n- Output format stability is important\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"prep_study_data produces expected structure\", {\n  result &lt;- prep_study_data(raw_data)\n  expect_snapshot_value(result, style = \"serialize\")\n})\n\n\n6.3.9 When to Use Explicit Value Tests\nUse explicit tests (expect_equal(), expect_identical()) when:\n\nTesting simple scalar outputs\nValidating specific numeric thresholds\nTesting Boolean returns or categorical outputs\n\ntest_that(\"calculate_mean returns correct value\", {\n  expect_equal(calculate_mean(c(1, 2, 3)), 2)\n  expect_equal(calculate_ratio(3, 7), 0.4285714, tolerance = 1e-6)\n})\n\n\n6.3.10 Testing Best Practices\n\nSeed randomness: Use withr::local_seed() for reproducible tests\nUse small test cases: Keep tests fast\nTest edge cases: Missing values, empty inputs, boundary conditions\nTest errors: Verify functions fail appropriately with invalid input\n\ntest_that(\"prep_study_data handles edge cases\", {\n  # Empty input\n  expect_error(prep_study_data(data.frame()))\n  \n  # Missing required columns\n  expect_error(prep_study_data(data.frame(x = 1)))\n  \n  # Valid input with missing values\n  result &lt;- prep_study_data(data.frame(id = 1:3, value = c(1, NA, 3)))\n  expect_true(all(!is.na(result$value)))\n})",

    "section": "6.9 Documenting your code",
    "text": "6.9 Documenting your code\n\n6.9.1 Function headers\nEvery function you write must include documentation to describe its purpose, inputs, and outputs. For any reproducible workflows, this is essential, because R is dynamically typed. This means you can pass a string into an argument that is meant to be a data.table, or a list into an argument meant for a tibble. It is the responsibility of a function’s author to document what each argument is meant to do and its basic type.\nWe use {roxygen2} (Wickham et al. 2024) for function documentation. Roxygen2 allows you to describe your functions in special comments next to their definitions, and automatically generates R documentation files (.Rd files) and helps manage your package NAMESPACE. The roxygen2 format uses #' comments placed immediately before the function definition.\nHere is an example of documenting a function using roxygen2:\n#' Calculate flu season means by site\n#'\n#' Make a dataframe with rows for flu season and site\n#' containing the number of patients with an outcome, the total patients,\n#' and the percent of patients with the outcome.\n#'\n#' @param data A data frame with variables flu_season, site, studyID, and yname\n#' @param yname A string for the outcome name\n#' @param silent A boolean specifying whether to suppress console output \n#'   (default: TRUE)\n#'\n#' @returns A dataframe as described above\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' calc_fluseas_mean(my_data, \"hospitalized\", silent = FALSE)\n#'\ncalc_fluseas_mean &lt;- function(data, yname, silent = TRUE) {\n  ### function code here\n  \n}\nThe roxygen2 header tells you what the function does, its various inputs, and how you might use it. Also notice that all optional arguments (i.e. ones with pre-specified defaults) follow arguments that require user input.\nFor more information on roxygen2 syntax and features, see https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs someone trying to call a function, it is possible to access a function’s documentation (and internal code) by CMD-Left-Clicking the function’s name in RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDepending on how important your function is, the complexity of your function code, and the complexity of different types of data in your project, you can also add “type-checking” to your function with the assertthat::assert_that() function. You can, for example, assert_that(is.data.frame(statistical_input)), which will ensure that collaborators or reviewers of your project attempting to use your function are using it in the way that it is intended by calling it with (at the minimum) the correct type of arguments. You can extend this to ensure that certain assumptions regarding the inputs are fulfilled as well (i.e. that time_column, location_column, value_column, and population_column all exist within the statistical_input tibble).\n\n\n\n\n6.9.2 Script headers\nEvery file in a project that doesn’t have roxygen function documentation should at least have a header that allows it to be interpreted on its own. It should include the name of the project and a short description for what this file (among the many in your project) does specifically. You may optionally wish to include the inputs and outputs of the script as well, though the next section makes this significantly less necessary.\n################################################################################\n# @Organization - Example Organization\n# @Project - Example Project\n# @Description - This file is responsible for [...]\n################################################################################\n\n\n\n6.9.3 Sections and subsections\nRstudio (v1.4 or more recent) supports the use of Sections and Subsections. You can easily navigate through longer scripts using the navigation pane in RStudio, as shown on the right below.\n# Section -------\n\n## Subsection -------\n\n### Sub-subsection -------\n\n\n6.9.4 Code folding\nConsider using RStudio’s code folding feature to collapse and expand different sections of your code. Any comment line with at least four trailing dashes (-), equal signs (=), or pound signs (#) automatically creates a code section. For example:\n\n\n6.9.5 Comments in the body of your code\nCommenting your code is an important part of reproducibility and helps document your code for the future. When things change or break, you’ll be thankful for comments. There’s no need to comment excessively or unnecessarily, but a comment describing what a large or complex chunk of code does is always helpful. See this file for an example of how to comment your code and notice that comments are always in the form of:\n# This is a comment -- first letter is capitalized and spaced away from the pound sign\nSee also Section 7.2 for function documentation style guidelines.",

    "text": "6.10 Object naming\nGenerally we recommend using nouns for objects and verbs for functions. This is because functions are performing actions, while objects are not.\nTry to make your variable names both more expressive and more explicit. Being a bit more verbose is useful and easy in the age of autocompletion! For example, instead of naming a variable vaxcov_1718, try naming it vaccination_coverage_2017_18. Similarly, flu_res could be named absentee_flu_residuals, making your code more readable and explicit.\n\nFor more help, check out Be Expressive: How to Give Your Variables Better Names\n\nWe recommend you use snake_case.\n\nBase R allows . in variable names and functions (such as read.csv()), but this goes against best practices for variable naming in many other coding languages. For consistency’s sake, snake_case has been adopted across languages, and modern packages and functions typically use it (i.e. readr::read_csv()). As a very general rule of thumb, if a package you’re using doesn’t use snake_case, there may be an updated version or more modern package that does, bringing with it the variety of performance improvements and bug fixes inherent in more mature and modern software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may also see camelCase throughout the R code you come across. This is okay but not ideal – try to stay consistent across all your code with snake_case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAgain, it’s also worth noting there’s nothing inherently wrong with using . in variable names, just that it goes against style best practices that are cropping up in data science, so it’s worth getting rid of these bad habits now.\n\n\nSee also Section 7.10.",

The biggest problems with this practice include an inability to control the names of things getting loaded in, the inherent confusion this creates in understanding older code, and the inability to load individual elements of a saved file. For this, we recommend using the RDS format to save R objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have many related R objects you would have otherwise saved all together using the save function, the functional equivalent with RDS would be to create a (named) list containing each of these objects, and saving it.\n\n\n\n\n6.13.2 CSVs\nOnce again, the readr package as part of the Tidvyerse is great, with a much faster read_csv() than Base R’s read.csv().

    "text": "6.14 Integrating Box and Dropbox\nBox and Dropbox are cloud-based file sharing systems that are useful when dealing with large files. When our scripts generate large output files, the files can slow down the workflow if they are pushed to GitHub. This makes collaboration difficult when not everyone has a copy of the file, unless we decide to duplicate files and share them manually. The files might also take up a lot of local storage. Box and Dropbox help us avoid these issues by automatically storing the files, reading data, and writing data back to the cloud.\nBox and Dropbox are separate platforms, but we can use either one to store and share files. To use them, we can install the packages that have been created to integrate Box and Dropbox into R. The set-up instructions are detailed below.\nMake sure to authenticate before reading and writing from either Box or Dropbox. The authentication commands should go in the configuration file; it only needs to be done once. This will prompt you to give your login credentials for Box and Dropbox and will allow your application to access your shared folders.\n\n6.14.1 Box\nFollow the instructions in this section to use the boxr package. Note that there are a few setup steps that need to be done on the box website before you can use the boxr package, explained here in the section “Creating an Interactive App.” This gets the authentication keys that must be put in box. Once that is done, add the authentication keys to your code in the configuration file, with box_auth(client_id = \"&lt;your_client_id&gt;\", client_secret = \"&lt;your_client_secret_id&gt;\"). It is also important to set the default working directory so that the code can reference the correct folder in box: box_setwd(&lt;folder_id&gt;). The folder ID is the sequence of digits at the end of the URL.\nFurther details can be found here.\n\n\n6.14.2 Dropbox\nFollow the instructions at this link to use the rdrop2 package. Similar to the boxr package, you must authenticate before reading and writing from Dropbox, which can be done by adding drop_auth() to the configuration file.\nSaving the authentication token is not required, although it may be useful if you plan on using Dropbox frequently. To do so, save the token with the following commands. Tokens are valid until they are manually revoked.\n# first time only\n# save the output of drop_auth to an RDS file\ntoken &lt;- drop_auth()\n# this token only has to be generated once, it is valid until revoked\nsaveRDS(token, \"/path/to/tokenfile.RDS\")\n\n# all future usages\n# to use a stored token, provide the rdstoken argument\ndrop_auth(rdstoken = \"/path/to/tokenfile.RDS\")",

    "text": "6.17 Repeating analyses with different variations\nIn many cases, we will need to apply our modeling on different combinations of interests (outcomes, exposures, etc.). We can certainly use a for loop to repeat the execution of a wrapper function, but generally, for loops request high memory usage and produce the results in long computation time.\nFortunately, R has some functions which implement looping in a compact form to help repeating your analyses with different variations (subgroups, outcomes, covariate sets, etc.) with better performances.\n\n6.17.1 lapply() and sapply()\nlapply() is a function in the base R package that applies a function to each element of a list and returns a list. It’s typically faster than for. Here is a simple generic example:\nresult &lt;- lapply(X = mylist, FUN = func)\nThere is another very similar function called sapply(). It also takes a list as its input, but if the output of the func is of the same length for each element in the input list, then sapply() will simplify the output to the simplest data structure possible, which will usually be a vector.\n\n\n6.17.2 mapply() and pmap()\nSometimes, we’d like to employ a wrapper function that takes arguments from multiple different lists/vectors. Then, we can consider using mapply() from the base R package or pmap() from the purrr package.\nPlease see the simple specific example below where the two input lists are of the same length and we are doing a pairwise calculation:\nmylist1 = list(0:3)\nmylist2 = list(6:9)\nmylists = list(mylist1, mylist2)\n\nsquare_sum &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  x^2 + y^2\n}\n\n#Use `mapply()`\nresult1 &lt;- mapply(FUN = square_sum, mylist1, mylist2)\n\n#Use `pmap()`\nlibrary(purrr)\nresult2 &lt;- pmap(.l = mylists, .f = square_sum)\n\n#unlist(as.list(result1)) = result2 = [36 50 68 90]\n\nThere are two major differences between mapply() and pmap(). The first difference is that mapply() takes seperate lists as its input arguments, while pmap() takes a list of list. Secondly, the output of mapply() will be in the form of a matrix or an array, but pmap() produces a list directly.\nHowever, when the input lists are of different lengths AND/OR the wrapper function doesn’t take arguments in pairs, mapply() and pmap() may not give the preferable results.\nBoth mapply() and pmap() will recycle shorter input lists to match the length of the longest input list. Assume that now mylist2 = list(6:12). Then, pmap(mylists, square_sum) will generate [36  50  68  90 100 122 148] where elements 0, 1, and 2 are recycled to match 10, 11, and 12. And it will return an error message that “longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length.”\nThus, unless the recycling pattern described above is desirable feature for a certain experiment design, when the input lists are of different lengths, the best practice is probably to use lapply() and then combine the results.\nHere is an example where we’d like to find the square_sum for every element combination of mylist1 and mylist2.\nmylist1 &lt;- list(0:3)\nmylist2 &lt;- list(6:12)\n\nsquare_sum &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  x^2 + y^2\n}\n\nresults &lt;- list()\n\nfor (i in seq_along(mylist1[[1]])) {\n  result &lt;- lapply(X = mylist2, FUN = function(y) square_sum(mylist1[[1]][i], y))\n  results[[i]] &lt;- result\n}\n\nThis example doesn’t work in the way that 0 is paired to 6, 1 is paired to 7, and so on. Instead, every element in mylist1 will be paired with every element in mylist2. Thus, the “unlisted” results from the example will have \\(4*7 = 28\\) elements.\nWe can use flatten() or unlist() functions to decrease the depths of our results. If the results are data frames, then we will need to use bind_rows() to combine them.\n\n\n6.17.3 Parallel processing with parallel and future packages\nOne big drawback of lapply() is its long computation time, especially when the list length is long. Fortunately, computers nowadays must have multiple cores which makes parallel processing possible to help make computation much faster.\nAssume you have a list called mylist of length 1000, and lapply(X = mylist, FUN = func) applies the function to each of the 1000 elements one by one in \\(T\\) seconds. If we could execute the func in \\(n\\) processors simultaneously, then ideally, we would shrink the computation time to \\(T/n\\) seconds.\nIn practice, using functions under the parallel and the future packages, we can split mylist into smaller chunks and apply the function to each element of the several chunks in parallel in different cores to significantly reduce the run time.\n\n6.17.3.1 parLapply()\nBelow is a generic example of parLapply():\nlibrary(parallel)\n\n# Set how many processors will be used to process the list and make cluster\nn_cores &lt;- 4\ncl &lt;- makeCluster(n_cores)\n\n#Use parLapply() to apply func to each element in mylist\nresult &lt;- parLapply(cl = cl, x = mylist, FUN = func)\n\n#Stop the parallel processing\nstopCluster(cl)\nLet’s still assume mylist is of length 1000. The parLapply above splits mylist into 4 sub-lists each of length 250 and applies the function to the elements of each sub-list in parallel. To be more specific, first apply the function to element 1, 251, 501, 751; second apply to element 2, 252, 502, 752; so on and so forth. As such, the computation time will be greatly reduced.\nYou can use parallel::detectCores() to test how many cores your machine has and to help decide what to put for n_cores. It would be a good idea to leave at least one core free for the operating system to use.\nWe will always start parLapply() with makeCluster(). stopCluster() is not fully necessary but follows the best practices. If not stopped, the processing will continue in the back end and consuming the computation capacity for other software in your machine. But keep in mind that stopping the cluster is similar quitting R, meaning that you will need to re-load the packages needed when you need to do parallel processing use parLapply() again.\n\n\n6.17.3.2 future.lapply()\nBelow is a generic example of future.lapply():\nlibrary(future)\nlibrary(future.apply)\n\n# First, plan how the future_lapply() will be resolved\nfuture::plan(\n  multisession, workers = future::availableCores() - 1\n)\n\n# Use future_lapply() to apply func to each element in mylist\nfuture_lapply(x = mylist, FUN = func)\nHere, future::availableCores() checks how many cores your machine has. Similar to parLapply() showed above, future_lapply() parallelizes the computation of lapply() by executing the function func simultaneously on different sub-lists of mylist.",

GitHub makes it possible to document all of these changes in a pull request. Pull requests can be used to describe changes in a branch that are ready to be merged with the base branch (more information in the GitHub section).\nThis section provides guidance on both constructing effective pull requests and reviewing code submitted by others.

    "section": "6.19 Constructing Pull Requests",
    "text": "6.19 Constructing Pull Requests\n\n6.19.1 Write Focused PRs\nA focused pull request is one self-contained change that addresses just one thing. Writing focused PRs has several benefits:\n\nFaster reviews: It’s easier for a reviewer to find 5-10 minutes to review a single bug fix than to set aside an hour for one large PR implementing many features.\nMore thorough reviews: Large PRs with many changes can overwhelm reviewers, leading to important points being missed.\nFewer bugs: Smaller changes make it easier to reason about impacts and identify potential issues.\nEasier to merge: Large PRs take longer and are more likely to have merge conflicts.\nLess wasted work: If the overall direction is wrong, you’ve wasted less time on a small PR.\n\nAs a guideline, 100 lines is usually a reasonable size for a PR, and 1000 lines is usually too large. However, the number of files affected also matters—a 200-line change in one file might be fine, but the same change spread across 50 files is usually too large.\n\n\n6.19.2 Writing PR Descriptions\nWhen you submit a pull request, include a detailed PR title and description. A comprehensive description helps your reviewer and provides valuable historical context.\nPR Title: The title should be a short summary (ideally under 72 characters) of what is being done. It should be informative enough that future developers can understand what the PR did without reading the full description.\nPoor titles that lack context:\n\n“Fix bug”\n“Add patch”\n“Moving code from A to B”\n\nBetter titles that summarize the actual change:\n\n“Fix missing value handling in data processing function”\n“Add support for custom date formats in import functions”\n\nPR Description Body: The description should provide context that helps the reviewer understand your PR. Consider including:\n\nA brief description of the problem being solved\nLinks to related issues (e.g., “Closes #123” or “Related to #456”)\nA before/after example showing changed behavior\nPossible shortcomings of the approach being used\nFor complex PRs, a suggested reading order for the reviewer\nThe Files tab of a Pull Request page on GitHub allows you to annotate your pull request with inline comments. These comments are not part of the source files; they only exist in GitHub’s metadata. Use these comments to explain changes whose reasoning might not be self-apparent to a reviewer.\n\n\n\n6.19.3 Add Tests\nFocused PRs should include related test code. A PR that adds or changes logic should be accompanied by new or updated tests for the new behavior. Pure refactoring PRs should also be covered by tests—if tests don’t exist for code you’re refactoring, add them in a separate PR first to validate that behavior is unchanged.\n\n\n6.19.4 Separate Out Refactorings\nIt’s usually best to do refactorings in a separate PR from feature changes or bug fixes. For example, moving and renaming a function should be in a different PR from fixing a bug in that function. This makes it much easier for reviewers to understand the changes introduced by each PR.\nSmall cleanups (like fixing a local variable name) can be included in a feature change or bug fix PR, but large refactorings should be separate.",

    "section": "6.20 Reviewing Pull Requests",
    "text": "6.20 Reviewing Pull Requests\n\n6.20.1 Purpose of Code Review\nThe primary purpose of code review is to ensure that the overall code health of our projects improves over time. Reviewers should balance the need to make forward progress with the importance of maintaining code quality.\nKey principle: Reviewers should favor approving a PR once it is in a state where it definitely improves the overall code health of the system, even if the PR isn’t perfect. There is no such thing as “perfect” code—there is only better code. Rather than seeking perfection, seek continuous improvement.\n\n\n6.20.2 Writing Review Comments\nWhen reviewing code, maintain courtesy and respect while being clear and helpful:\n\nComment on the code, not the author\nExplain why you’re making suggestions (reference best practices, design patterns, or how the suggestion improves code health)\nBalance pointing out problems with providing guidance (help authors learn while being constructive)\nHighlight positive aspects too—if you see good practices, comment on those to reinforce them\n\nPoor comment: “Why did you use this approach when there’s obviously a better way?”\nBetter comment: “This approach adds complexity without clear benefits. Consider using [alternative approach] instead, which would simplify the logic and improve readability.”\n\n\n6.20.3 Mentoring Through Review\nCode review is an excellent opportunity for mentoring. As a reviewer:\n\nLeave comments that help authors learn something new\nLink to relevant sections of style guides or best practices documentation\nConsider pair programming for complex reviews—live review sessions can be very effective for teaching\n\n\n\n6.20.4 Giving Constructive Feedback\nIn general, it is the author’s responsibility to fix a PR, not the reviewer’s. Strike a balance between pointing out problems and providing direct guidance. Sometimes pointing out issues and letting the author decide on a solution helps them learn and may result in a better solution since they are closer to the code.\nFor very small tweaks (typos, comment additions), use GitHub’s suggestion feature to allow authors to quickly accept changes directly in the UI.",

Very generally, you want to\n\nsource your config =&gt;\nload all your data =&gt;\ndo all your analysis/computation =&gt; save your data.\n\nEach of these sections should be “chunked together” using comments. See this file for a good example of how to cleanly organize a file in a way that follows this “flow” and functionally separate pieces of code that are doing different things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your computer isn’t able to handle this workflow due to RAM or requirements, modifying the ordering of your code to accommodate it won’t be ultimately helpful and your code will be fragile, not to mention less readable and messy. You need to look into high-performance computing (HPC) resources in this case.\n\n\nSingle-Line Comments - Commenting your code is an important part of reproducibility and helps document your code for the future. When things change or break, you’ll be thankful for comments. There’s no need to comment excessively or unnecessarily, but a comment describing what a large or complex chunk of code does is always helpful. See this file for an example of how to comment your code and notice that comments are always in the form of:\n# This is a comment -- first letter is capitalized and spaced away from the pound sign\nMulti-Line Comments - Occasionally, multi-line comments are necessary. You should manually insert line breaks to “hard-wrap” code and comments, whenever lines become longer than 80 characters. lintr should object otherwise, even for comments. Try to break lines at semantic boundaries: ends of sentences or phrases. Long lines in source code files make it more difficult to see and comment on diffs in pull requests.\nIn prose text chunks, Quarto ignores single line breaks, so you should also line-break your prose text in .qmd files to keep them under 80 characters.\nYou can configure RStudio’s settings to display the 80-character margin.",

Being a bit more verbose is useful and easy in the age of autocompletion! For example, instead of naming a variable vaxcov_1718, try naming it vaccination_coverage_2017_18. Similarly, flu_res could be named absentee_flu_residuals, making your code more readable and explicit.\nBase R allows . in variable names and functions (such as read.csv()), but this goes against best practices for variable naming in many other coding languages. For consistency’s sake, snake_case has been adopted across languages, and modern packages and functions typically use it (i.e. readr::read_csv()). As a very general rule of thumb, if a package you’re using doesn’t use snake_case, there may be an updated version or more modern package that does, bringing with it the variety of performance improvements and bug fixes inherent in more mature and modern software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may also see camelCase throughout the R code you come across.

The most useful function of the package is the style_dir function, which will style all files within a given directory. See the function’s documentation and the vignette linked above for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe default Tidyverse styler is subtly different from some of the things we’ve advocated for in this document. Most notably we differ with regards to the assignment operator (&lt;- vs =) and number of spaces before/after “tokens” (i.e. Assignment Aligner add spaces before = signs to align them properly). For this reason, we’d recommend the following: style_dir(path = ..., scope = \"line_breaks\", strict = FALSE). You can also customize {styler} even more if you’re really hardcore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs is mentioned in the package vignette linked above, {styler} modifies things in-place, meaning it overwrites your existing code and replaces it with the updated, properly styled code. This makes it a good fit on projects with version control, but if you don’t have backups or a good way to revert back to the initial code, I wouldn’t recommend going this route.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipstyler Package\n\n\n\nFor automated styling of entire projects:\n# Install styler\ninstall.packages(\"styler\")\n\n# Style all files in R/ directory\nstyler::style_dir(\"R/\")\n\n# Style entire package\nstyler::style_pkg()\n\n# Note: styler modifies files in-place\n# Always use with version control so you can review changes\n\n\n\n\n7.11.1.3 {lintr}\nLinters are programming tools that check adherence to a given style, syntax errors, and possible semantic issues. The R linter, called lintr, can be found in this package. It helps keep files consistent across different authors and even different organizations. For example, it notifies you if you have unused variables, global variables with no visible binding, not enough or superfluous whitespace, and improper use of parentheses or brackets. A list of its other purposes can be found in this link, and most guidelines are based on Hadley Wickham’s R Style Guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can customize your settings to set defaults or to exclude files. More details can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe lintr package goes hand in hand with the styler package. The styler can be used to automatically fix the problems that the lintr catches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiplintr package\n\n\n\nFor checking code style without modifying files:\n# Install lintr\ninstall.packages(\"lintr\")\n\n# Lint the entire package\nlintr::lint_package()\n\n# Lint a specific file\nlintr::lint(\"R/my_function.R\")\nThe linter checks for:\n\nUnused variables\nImproper whitespace\nLine length issues\nStyle guide violations\n\nYou can customize linting rules by creating a .lintr or lintr.R file in your project root.",

Generally I would define this as 10+ million rows. As is outlined in this document, the 3 main players in the data analysis space are Base R, Tidvyerse (more specificially, dplyr), and data.table. For a majority of things, Base R is inferior to both dplyr and data.table, with concise but less clear syntax and less speed. Dplyr is architected for medium and smaller data, and while its very fast for everyday usage, it trades off maximum performance for ease of use and syntax compared to data.table. An overview of the dplyr vs data.table debate can be found in this stackoverflow post and all 3 answers are worth a read.\nYou can also achieve a performance boost by running dplyr commands on data.tables, which I find to be the best of both worlds, given that a data.table is a special type of data.frame and fairly easy to convert with the as.data.table() function. The speedup is due to dplyr’s use of the data.table backend and in the future this coupling should become even more natural.\nIf you want to test whether using a certain coding approach increases speed, consider the tictoc package. Run tic() before a code chunk and toc() after to measure the amount of system time it takes to run the chunk. For example, you might use this to decide if you really need to switch a code chunk from dplyr to data.table.",

In our lab, data masking most frequently comes up when writing wrapper functions where arguments to indicate column names are supplied as strings. We often do this when we repeat the same code on multiple columns, and want to apply a function to a vector of strings that correspond to column names in a dataframe. For example, we might want to clean multiple columns using the same function or estimate the same model under different feature sets. Here, we try to break down what data masking is, why this error comes up, and common approaches to solve this problem.",

    "text": "9.1.1 What is Data Masking?\nWithin certain tidyverse operations, columns are called as if they were variables. For example, while running df |&gt; mutate(X = …) R recognizes that X specifically references a column in df without explicitly stating its membership df |&gt; mutate(df$X = …) or calling the column name as a string df |&gt; mutate(“X” = …).\n\nHowever, this behavior may introduce errors when we attempt to incorporate variables from the global environment within these tidyverse pipelines. In the example above, column_name = “X” followed by df |&gt; mutate(X2 = column_name + 1) would yield an error, since column_name is not a column in df and the variable column_name is not defined within the environment of df\n\n\n9.1.2 Using tidy evaluation for data masking\nIn dplyr-based R programming, we make use of tidy evaluation. This allows us to avoid using base R syntax to reference specific columns in a data frame. By leveraging Tidy evaluation-based data masking, we can employ long pipes with several dplyr verbs to manipulate our data using stand-alone variables that store column names as strings.\nFor example, consider a data frame “df” that contains a column called “heavyrain” that we want to manipulate. Suppose we wanted to convert the values of “heavyrain” into a factor.\nUsing base R, which does not mask data, heavyrain must have quotes to be treated as a data-variable:\ndf[[“outcome”]] = as.factor(df[[“heavyrain”]])\nIn a dplyr pipe, heavyrain is being masked using tidy evaluation and will be correctly interpreted as a column because it is recognized as a data-variable: df |&gt; mutate(outcome = as.factor(heavyrain))\nWith modified data masking, heavyrain is a string that is coerced into being recognized as a data-variable:\nvar_name = “heavyrain”\ndf |&gt; mutate(outcome = as.factor(!!sym(var_name)) \nWhile cleaner and often more convenient, the data frame that var_name is in is now “masked” and we refer to the vectors in the dataframe (data-variables) as though it is an object of its own (an environmental-variable). This is why we can just say the variable’s name in the context of a pipe – we treat it as though it’s an object defined in our environment. Within normal scripts, this is usually fine, because the data frame is “held on to” in the pipe. However, it can cause some programming hurdles when writing functions that take strings of variable/column names as arguments. In the next section, we briefly describe how to troubleshoot common errors in data masking, as relevant to our lab’s work.",

    "section": "9.2 Technical Overview",
    "text": "9.2 Technical Overview\nThis section covers the R functions and tools that we often use in the context of data masking, focusing on the bang bang operator (!!) with symbol coercion (sym()) and the Walrus operator (:=).\nThe combined use of !! and sym() allows us to use strings, rather than data-variables, to reference column names within dplyr. Together, !!sym(“column_name”) forces dplyr to recognize “column_name” as a data-variable prior to evaluating the rest of the expression, enabling the ability to perform calculations on the column while referring to it as a string. sym() is a function that turns strings into symbols. In the context of a dplyr pipe, these symbols are interpreted as data-variables. The !! (bang bang) operator tells dplyr to evaluate the sym() expression first, e.g. to unquote its expression (e.g. “column_name”) and evaluate it as a pre-existing object, first. This is helpful because often we use sym(“column_name”) within a larger expression, and dplyr might evaluate other elements of the expression first without !!, causing errors.\nWhen we want to create a new column (via mutate or summarize), the Walrus operator (:=) allows us to specify the new column’s name using a string. For example, while df |&gt; mutate(“new_column” = values) would yield an error, df |&gt; mutate(“new_column” := values) will correctly create a new column called “new_column”. If we want to use a variable representing a string, we can use !! to force the variable to be evaluated before using := to assign the value of the new column.\ncol_name = “new_column”\ndf |&gt; mutate(!!col_name := values)\n\n9.2.1 Example\nSuppose we want to write a function “generate_descriptive_table” to summarize how the prevalence of “outcome” varies under different levels of a “risk_factor” in a data frame “df”\nWe can start by writing the function shell:\ngenerate_descriptive_table &lt;- function (df, outcome, rf) {\noutcome_dist_by_rf &lt;- ….\nreturn(outcome_dist_by_rf)\n}\nNext, we can filter the data frame for only rows in which “rf” and “outcome” are not missing. We can use !! and sym() within filter to evaluate the strings stored in “rf” and “outcome”. Note that defining !!sym(outcome) or !!sym(outcome) in variables outside of the dplyr pipeline will not work.\ngenerate_descriptive_table &lt;- function (df, outcome, rf,) {\n  outcome_dist_by_rf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(!!sym(outcome)), !is.na(!!sym(rf))) |&gt;\n  ….\n  return(outcome_dist_by_rf)\n}\nSimilarly, we use !! and sym() in group_by to evaluate column name, stored as a string in the argument “rf”\ngenerate_descriptive_table &lt;- function (df, outcome, rf,) {\n  outcome_dist_by_rf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(!!sym(outcome)), !is.na(!!sym(rf))) |&gt;\n  ….\n  return(outcome_dist_by_rf)\n}\nFinally, we can use the walrus operator, !! and sym() with “summarize” to create a new column that takes the mean of the column referenced in “rf”. We also use “glue” or “paste” to give the new column an informative name that includes the “outcome” it describes.\ngenerate_descriptive_table &lt;- function (df, outcome, rf,) {\n  outcome_dist_by_rf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(!!sym(outcome)), !is.na(!!sym(rf))) |&gt; \n  group_by(!!sym(rf)) |&gt;\n  summarize(!!(glue::glue(“{outcome}_prev”)) := mean(!!sym(outcome))) \n  return(outcome_dist_by_rf)\n}\nOR\ngenerate_descriptive_table &lt;- function (df, outcome, rf,) {\n  outcome_dist_by_rf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(!!sym(outcome)), !is.na(!!sym(rf))) |&gt; \n  group_by(!!sym(rf)) |&gt;\n  summarize(!!(paste0(outcome, ”_prev”)) := mean(!!sym(outcome)))\n  return(outcome_dist_by_rf)\n}\nOR\ngenerate_descriptive_table &lt;- function (df, outcome, rf,) {\n  new_column_name = paste0(outcome, ”_prev”)\n  outcome_dist_by_rf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(!!sym(outcome)), !is.na(!!sym(rf))) |&gt; \n  group_by(!!sym(rf)) |&gt;\n  summarize(!!(new_column_name) := mean(!!sym(outcome))) \n  return(outcome_dist_by_rf)\n}",

This allows you to run R commands from the command line. If Rscript is in your PATH, then typing Rscript into the command line, and pressing enter, will not error. Otherwise, to use Rscript, you will either need to add it to your PATH (as an environment variable), or append the full directory of the location of Rscript on your machine. To find the full directory, search for where R is installed your computer. For instance, it may be something like below (this will vary depending on what version of R you have installed):\nC:\\Program Files\\R\\R-3.6.0\\bin\nFor appending the PATH variable, please view this link. I strongly recommend completing this option.\nIf you add the PATH as an environment variable, then you can run this line of code to test: Rscript -e “cat(‘this is a test’)\", where the -e flag refers to the expression that will be executed.\nIf you do not add the PATH as an environment variable, then you can run this line of code to replicate the results from above: “C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-3.6.0\\bin” -e “cat(‘this is a test’)”\nTo run an R script from the command line, we can say: Rscript -e “source(‘C:/path/to/script/some_code.R’)”\n\n11.4.1 Common Mistakes\n\nRemember to include all of the quotation marks around file paths that have a spaces.\nIf you attempt to run an R script but run into Error: '\\U' used without hex digits in character string starting \"'C:\\U\", try replacing all \\ with \\\\ or /.",

    "section": "11.6 Running big jobs",
    "text": "11.6 Running big jobs\nFor big data workflows, the concept of “backgrounding” a bash script allows you to start a “job” (i.e. run the script) and leave it overnight to run. At the top level, a bash script (0-run-project.sh) that simply calls the directory-level bash scripts (i.e. 0-prep-data.sh, 0-run-analysis.sh, 0-run-figures.sh, etc.) is a powerful tool to rerun every script in your project. See the included example bash scripts for more details.\n\nRunning Bash Scripts in Background: Running a long bash script is not trivial. Normally you would run a bash script by opening a terminal and typing something like ./run-project.sh. But what if you leave your computer, log out of your server, or close the terminal? Normally, the bash script will exit and fail to complete. To run it in background, type ./run-project.sh &; disown. You can see the job running (and CPU utilization) with the command top or ps -v and check your memory with free -h.\n\nAlternatively, to keep code running in the background even when an SSH connection is broken, you can use tmux. In terminal or gitbash follow the steps below. This site has useful tips on using tmux.\n# create a new tmux session called session_name\ntmux new -ssession_name\n\n# run your job of interest\nR CMD BATCH myjob.R & \n  \n# check that it is running\nps -v\n\n# to exit the tmux session (Mac)\nctrl + b \nd\n\n# to reopen the tmux session to kill the job or \n# start another job\ntmux attach -tsession_name \n\nDeleting Previously Computed Results: One helpful lesson we’ve learned is that your bash scripts should remove previous results (computed and saved by scripts run at a previous time) so that you never mix results from one run with a previous run. This can happen when an R script errors out before saving its result, and can be difficult to catch because your previously saved result exists (leading you to believe everything ran correctly).\nEnsuring Things Ran Correctly: You should check the .Rout files generated by the R scripts run by your bash scripts for errors once things are run. A utility file is include in this repository, called runFileSaveLogs, and is used by the example bash scripts to… run files and save the generated logs. It is an awesome utility and one I definitely recommend using. Before using runFileSaveLogs, it is necessary to put the file in the home working directory. For help and documentation, you can use the command ./runFileSaveLogs -h. See example code and example usage for runFileSaveLogs below.\n\n\n11.6.1 Example code for runfileSaveLogs\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# Type \"./runFileSaveLogs -h\" for help\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport argparse\nimport getpass\nimport datetime\nimport shutil\nimport glob\nimport pathlib\n\n# Setting working directory to this script's current directory\nos.chdir(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))\n\n# Setting up argument parser\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Runs the argument R script(s) - in parallel if specified - and moves the subsequent generated .Rout log files to a timestamped directory.')\n\n# Function ensuring that the file is valid\ndef is_valid_file(parser, arg):\n    if not os.path.exists(arg):\n        parser.error(\"The file %s does not exist!\" % arg)\n    else:\n        return arg\n\n# Function ensuring that the directory is valid\ndef is_valid_directory(parser, arg):\n    if not os.path.isdir(arg):\n        parser.error(\"The specified path (%s) is not a directory!\" % arg)\n    else:\n        return arg\n\n# Additional arguments that can be added when running runFileSaveLogs\nparser.add_argument('-p', '--parallel', action='store_true', help=\"Runs the argument R scripts in parallel if specified\")\nparser.add_argument(\"-i\", \"--identifier\", help=\"Adds an identifier to the directory name where this is saved\")\nparser.add_argument('filenames', nargs='+', type=lambda x: is_valid_file(parser, x))\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\nargs_dict = vars(args)\n\nprint(args_dict)\n\n# Run given R Scripts\nfor filename in args_dict[\"filenames\"]:\n  system_call = \"R CMD BATCH\" + \" \" + filename\n  if args_dict[\"parallel\"]: \n    system_call = \"nohup\" + \" \" + system_call + \" &\"\n\n  os.system(system_call)\n\n# Create the directory (and any parents) of the log files\ncurrentUser = getpass.getuser()\ncurrentTime = datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\nlogDirPrefix = \"/home/kaiserData/logs/\" # Change to the directory where the logs should be saved\nlogDir = logDirPrefix + currentTime + \"-\" + currentUser \n\n# If specified, adds the identifier to the filename of the log\nif args.identifier is not None:\n  logDir += \"-\" + args.identifier\n\nlogDir += \"/\"\n\npathlib.Path(logDir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Find and move all logs to this new directory\ncurrentLogPaths = glob.glob('./*.Rout')\n\nfor currentLogPath in currentLogPaths:\n  filename = currentLogPath.split(\"/\")[-1]\n  shutil.move(currentLogPath, logDir + filename)\n\n\n11.6.2 Example usage for runfileSaveLogs\nThis example bash script runs files and generates logs for five scripts in the kaiserflu/3-figures folder.

    "section": "",
    "text": "12.1.1 Introduction\nReplicable code should produce the same results, regardless of when or where it’s run. However, our analyses often leverage open-source R packages that are developed by other teams. These packages continue to be developed after research projects are completed, which may include changes to analysis functions that could impact how code runs for both other team members and external replicators.\nFor example, suppose we had used a function that took in one argument, such that our code contained example_function(arg_a = “a”). A few months after we publish our code, the package developers update the function to take in another mandatory argument arg_b. If someone runs our code, but has the most recent version of the package, they’ll receive an error message that the argument arg_b is missing and will not be able to full reproduce our results.\nTo ensure that the right functions are used in replication efforts, it is important for us to keep track of package versions used in each project.\nrenv can be to promote reproducible environments within R projects. renv creates individual package libraries for each project instead of having all projects, which may use different versions of the same package, share the same package library. However, for projects that use many packages, this process can be memory intensive and increase the time needed for a new users to start running code.\nIn this lab manual chapter, we provide a quick tutorial for integrating renv into research workflows. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the renv package vignette.\n\n\n12.1.2 Implementing renv in projects\nIdeally, renv should be initiated at the start of projects and updated continuously when new packages are introduced in the codebase. However, this process can be initated at any point in a project\nTo add renv to your workflow, follow these steps:\n\nInstall the renv package by running install.packages(“renv”)\nCreate an RProject file and ensure that your working directory is set to the correct folder\nIn the R console, run renv::init() to intiialize renv in your R Project\nThis will create the following files: renv.lock, .Rprofile, renv/settings.json and renv/activate.R. Commit and push these files to GitHub so that they’re accessible to other users.\nAs you write code, update the project’s R library by running renv::snapshot() in the R console\nAdd renv::restore() to the head of your config file, to make sure that all users that run your code are on the same package versions.\n\n\n\n12.1.3 Using projects with renv\nIf you’re starting to work on an ongoing project that already has renv set up, follow these steps to ensure that you’re using the same project versions.\n\nInstall the renv package by running install.packages(“renv”)\nPull the most updated version of the project from GitHub\nOpen the project’s RProject file\nRun renv::restore(). In our lab’s projects, this is often already found at the top of the config file, so you can just run scripts as is.\nThis will pull up a list of the project’s packages that need to be updated for you to be consistent with the project. The console will ask if you want to proceed with updating these packages - type “Y” to continue.\nWait for the correct versions of each package to install/update. This may take some time, depending on how many packages the project uses.\nYour R environment should now be using the same package versions as specified in the renv lock file. You should now be able to replicate the code.\nIf you make edits to the code and introduce new/updated packages, see the section above for instructions on how to make updates.",

We often also make available .rds files as well. For example, your mystudy/data/public directory could include three files for a single dataset, two with the actual data in .rds and .csv formats, and a third that describes their contents:\nIn general, datasets are usually too big to save on GitHub, but occasionally they are small. Here is an example of where we actually pushed the data directly to GitHub: https://github.com/ben-arnold/enterics-seroepi/tree/master/data .\nIf the data are bigger, then maintaining them under version control in your git repository can be unwieldy. Instead, we recommend using another stable repository that has version control, such as the Open Science Framework (osf.io). For example, all of the data from the WASH Benefits trials (led by investigators at Berkeley, icddr,b, IPA-Kenya and others) are all stored through data components nested within in OSF projects: https://osf.io/tprw2/. Another good option is Dryad (datadryad.org) or institutional digital repositories.\nWe recommend cross-linking public files in GitHub (scripts/notebooks only) and OSF/Dryad/institutional digital repositories.\nBelow are the main steps to making data public, after finalizing the analysis datasets and scripts:\n1. Remove Protected Health Information (PHI)\n2. Create public IDs or join already created public IDs to the data\n3. Create an OSF repository and/or Dryad/institutional digital repository\n4. Edit analysis scripts to run using the public datasets and test (optional)\n5. Create a public github page for analysis scripts and link to OSF and/or Dryad/Zenodo\n6. Go live",

    "text": "14.2 Removing PHI\nOnce the data is finalized for analysis, the first step is to strip it of Protected Health Information (PHI), or any other data that could be used to link back to specific participants, such as names, birth dates, or GPS coordinates at the village/neighborhood level or below. PHI includes, but is not limited to:\n\n14.2.1 Personal information\nThese are identifiers that directly point to specific individuals, such as:\n- Names, addresses, photographs, date of birth\n- A combination of age, sex, and geographic location (below population 20,000) is considered identifiable\n\n\n14.2.2 Dates\nAny specific dates (e.g., study visit dates, birth dates, treatment dates) are usually problematic.\n- If a dataset requires high resolution temporal information, coarsen visit or measurement dates to be two variables: year and week of the year (1-52).\n- If a dataset requires age, provide that information without a birth date (typically month resolution is sufficient)\n\n\nCaution! If making changes to the format of dates or ages, make sure your analysis code runs on these modified versions of the data (step 3)! \n\n\n\n\n14.2.3 Geographic information\nDo not include GPS coordinates (longitude, latitude) except in special circumstances where they have been obfuscated/shifted. Reach out to lab leadership before doing this because it can be complicated.\nDo not include place names or codes (e.g., US Zip Codes) if the place contains &lt;20,000 people. For villages or neighborhoods, code them with uninformative IDs. For sub-districts or districts, names are fine.\nIf an analysis requires GPS locations (e.g., to make a map), then typically we include a disclaimer in the article’s data availability statement that explains we cannot make GPS locations public to protect participant confidentiality. As a middle ground, we typically make our code public that runs on the geo-located data for transparency, even if independent researchers can’t actually run that code (although please be careful to ensure the code itself does not in any way include geographic identifiers).\nFor more examples of what constitutes PHI, please refer to this link: https://cphs.berkeley.edu/hipaa/hipaa18.html",

    "section": "14.3 Create public IDs",
    "text": "14.3 Create public IDs\n\n14.3.1 Rationale\nThe UC Davis IRB requires that public datasets not include the original study IDs to identify participants or other units in the study (such as village IDs). The reason is that those IDs are linked in our private datasets to PHI. By creating a new set of public IDs, the public dataset is one step further removed from the potential to link to PHI.\n\n\n14.3.2 A single set of public IDs for each study\nFor each study, it is ideal to create a single set of public IDs whenever possible. We could create a new set of public IDs for every public dataset, but the downside is that independent researchers could no longer link data that might be related. By creating a single set of public IDs associated with each internal study ID, public files retain the link.\nMaintaining a single set of public IDs requires a shared “bridge” dataset, that includes a row for each study ID and has the associated public ID. For studies with multiple levels of ID, we would typically have separate bridge datasets for each type of ID (e.g,. cluster ID, participant ID, etc.)\nCreate a public ID that can be used to uniquely identify participants and that can internally be linked to the original study IDs. We recommend creating a subdirectory in the study’s shared data directory to store the public IDs. The shared location enables multiple projects to use the same IDs. Create the IDs using a script that reads in the study IDs, creates a unique (uninformative) public ID for the study IDs, and then saves the bridge dataset. The script should be saved in the same directory as the public ID files.\n\n\nCaution! Note that small differences may arise if the new public IDs do not necessarily order participants in the same way as the internal IDs. The small differences are all in estimates that rely on resampling, such as Bootstrap CIs, permutation P-values, and TMLE, as the resampling process may lead tp slightly different re-samples. The key here, to ensure the results are consistent irrespective of the dataset used, is simply to not assign public IDs randomly. Use rank() on the internal ID instead of row_number() to ensure that the order is always the same. \n\n\n\n\n14.3.3 Example scripts\nWe have created a self-contained and reproducible example that you can run and replicate when making data public for your projects. It contains the following files and folders:\n\ndata/final/- folder containing the projects final data in both csv and rds formats\n\ncode/DEMO_generate_public_IDs.R- creates randomly generated public IDs that can be matched to the trial’s assigned patient IDs.\n\ndata/make_public/DEMO_internal_to_publicID.csv- the output from step #2, a bridge dataset with two variables- the new public ID and the patient’s assigned ID.\n\ncode/DEMO_create_public_datasets.R- joins the public IDs to the trial’s full dataset, and strips it of the assigned patient ID.\ndata/public/- folder containing the output from step #3- de-identified public dataset, in csv and rds formats, with uniquely identifying public IDs that cannot be easily linked back to the patient’s ID.\n\nThe example workflow is accessible via GitHub: https://github.com/proctor-ucsf/dcc-handbook/tree/master/templates/making-data-public",

Use the same name as the datasets, but with “-codebook.txt” / “-codebook.html” / “-codebook.csv” at the end (depending on the file format for the codebook). One nice option is the R codebook package, which also generates JSON output that is machine-readable.\n\n14.4.1 Steps for creating an Open Science Framework (OSF) repository:\n\nCreate a new OSF project per these instructions: https://help.osf.io/article/252-create-a-project\nCreate a data component and upload the datasets in .csv and .rds format along with the codebooks.

The first way is best for users who are comfortable working on the command line and editing code in base R. Even if you are not comfortable yet, this is probably the better way because these commands will transfer between different cluster computers using Slurm.\nTypically, you will want to initially test your scripts by initiating a development node using the command sdev. This will allocate a small amount of computing resources for 1 hour. You can access R via command line using the following code.\n# open development node\nsdev\n\n# Load all the modules required by the packages you are using\nmodule load MODULE NAME  \n\n# Load R (default version)*\nmodule load R \n\n# initiate R in command line\nR\n*Note: for collaboration purposes, it’s best for everyone to work with one version of R. Check what version is being used for the project you are working on. Some packages only work with some versions of R, so it’s best to keep it consistent.\n\n\n15.5.2 RStudio Server\nFor RStudio GUI computing, UC Davis provides mercury.ucdavis.edu. This is accessed through a web browser and provides an RStudio interface. You will be prompted to authenticate with your UC Davis credentials. This is the best way to work with R for people who are not comfortable accessing & editing in base R in a Shell application.\nNote that mercury does not have SLURM, so it’s best suited for interactive work and smaller computations. For large-scale computations requiring SLURM job scheduling, use shiva.ucdavis.edu instead.\nWhen using RStudio Server, you can test your code interactively. However, do NOT use the RStudio Server’s Terminal to install packages and configure your environment for SLURM-based clusters, as you will likely need to re-do it for every session/project. For SLURM clusters, use the command line approach described earlier.\n\n\n15.5.3 Filepaths & configuration on the cluster\nIn most cases, you will want to test that the file paths work correctly on the cluster. You will likely need to add code to the configuration file in the project repository that specifies cluster-specific file paths. Here is an example:\n# set cluster-specific file paths\nif(Sys.getenv(\"LMOD_SYSHOST\")!=\"\"){\n  \n  cluster_path = paste0(Sys.getenv(\"HOME\"), \"/project-name/\")\n  \n  data_path = paste0(cluster_path, \"data/\")\n  results_path = paste0(cluster_path, \"results/\")\n}",

    "text": "15.6 Storage & group storage access\n\n15.6.1 Individual storage\nThere are multiple places to store your files on computing clusters. Each user has their own $HOME directory as well as a $SCRATCH directory. These are directories that can be accessed via the command line once you’ve logged in to the cluster:\ncd $HOME \ncd /home/users/USERNAME # Alternatively, use the full path\n\ncd $SCRATCH\ncd /scratch/users/USERNAME # Full path\nYou can also navigate to these using the File Explorer if available through a web interface.\n$HOME typically has a volume quota (e.g., 15 GB). $SCRATCH typically has a larger volume quota (e.g., 100 TB), but files here may get deleted after a certain period of inactivity. Thus, use $SCRATCH for test files, exploratory analyses, and temporary storage. Use $HOME for long-term storage of important files and more finalized analyses.\nCheck with the UC Davis HPC documentation for specific storage options and quotas.\n\n\n15.6.2 Group storage\nThe lab may have shared $GROUP_HOME and $GROUP_SCRATCH directories to store files for collaborative use. These typically have larger quotas and may have different retention policies. You can access these via the command line or navigate to them using the File Explorer:\ncd $GROUP_HOME\ncd /home/groups/GROUPNAME\n\ncd $GROUP_SCRATCH\ncd /scratch/groups/GROUPNAME\nHowever, saving files to group storage can be tricky. You can try using the scp command in the section “Moving files to the cluster” to see if you have permission to add files to group directories. Read the next section to ensure any directories you create have the right permissions.\n\n\n15.6.3 Folder permissions\nGenerally, when we put folders in $GROUP_HOME or $GROUP_SCRATCH, it is so that we can collaborate on an analysis within the research group, so multiple people need to be able to access the folders. If you create a new folder in $GROUP_HOME or $GROUP_SCRATCH, please check the folder’s permissions to ensure that other group members are able to access its contents. To check the permissions of a folder, navigate to the level above it, and enter ls -l. You will see output like this:\ndrwxrwxrwx 2 jadebc jadebc  2204 Jun 17 13:12 myfolder\nPlease review this website to learn how to interpret the code on the left side of this output. The website also tells you how to change folder permissions. In order to ensure that all users and group members are able to access a folder’s contents, you can use the following command:\nchmod ugo+rwx FOLDER_NAME",

    "section": "16.4 Coding Agents",
    "text": "16.4 Coding Agents\nWe recommend using Coding Agents (AI agents specialized for coding) for AI-assisted coding.\n\n16.4.1 How to Work with Coding Agents\nGitHub Copilot coding agents can be used in several ways to automate development tasks:\n\n16.4.1.1 Assigning Issues to Copilot\nYou can assign GitHub Issues directly to @copilot just like you would assign to a human collaborator:\n\nOn GitHub.com: Navigate to an issue and assign it to Copilot in the assignees section\nIn VS Code: In the GitHub Pull Requests or Issues view, right-click an issue and select “Assign to Copilot”\nFrom Copilot Chat: Delegate tasks to Copilot directly from the chat interface in supported editors\n\n\n\n16.4.1.2 The Agent Workflow\nOnce assigned an issue, the coding agent follows an autonomous workflow:\n\nAnalysis: Reviews the issue description, related discussions, repository instructions, and codebase context\nPlanning: Determines what changes are needed and creates a work plan\nDevelopment: Works in an isolated GitHub Actions environment, modifies code, runs tests and linters, and validates changes\nPull Request Creation: Creates a draft pull request with implemented changes, audit logs, and a summary of modifications\nReview and Iteration: You review the PR and can request changes; the agent will iterate based on your feedback\n\n\n\n16.4.1.3 Example: This Document\nThis very section you’re reading was created through the coding agent workflow:\n\nIssue created: Issue #42 requested adding discussion about benefits and hazards of coding agents, including a Matrix film connection and best practices\nAgent assigned: The issue was assigned to @copilot\nWork completed: The agent analyzed the requirements, reviewed the repository structure, and implemented the changes across multiple files\nPull request: PR #50 was created with comprehensive content about coding agents, including this “How to Work with Coding Agents” section, benefits and hazards discussion, best practices, and firewall configuration details\nIteration: The PR received feedback comments requesting additional links, improved wording, and this example section—all of which the agent addressed through follow-up commits\n\nThis demonstrates the full lifecycle of working with a coding agent on a real documentation task.\n\n\n16.4.1.4 Collaborating with Coding Agents\nBetween iterations of asking coding agents to extend a PR, human collaborators can also push changes directly to the PR branch. This allows for a collaborative workflow where both humans and agents contribute:\n\nHuman contributions: You can make quick fixes, add content, or refine the agent’s work by pushing commits to the same branch\nAgent iterations: After your changes, you can ask the agent to continue working on additional requirements\n\nImportant: Try to avoid pushing changes while the coding agent is actively working. Simultaneous edits can produce conflicting diffs that:\n\nNeed to be manually resolved\nMay confuse both human and AI collaborators\nCould result in lost work or merge conflicts\n\nBest practice: Wait for the agent to complete its current iteration (indicated by the PR being updated) before pushing your own changes to the branch. Then assign new work to the agent for the next iteration.\n\n\n16.4.1.5 Directly Prompting for Pull Requests\nYou can also prompt Copilot to create pull requests without first creating an issue:\n\nUse Copilot Chat in your editor to describe the changes you want\nThe agent will analyze your request and create a pull request\nThis is useful for quick fixes or well-defined tasks\n\n\n\n16.4.1.6 Important Safeguards\n\nHuman approval required: Coding agents cannot merge their own changes\nBranch restrictions: Agents can only push to their own branches (e.g., copilot/*)\nFull transparency: All agent actions are logged and visible in the PR\n\nFor detailed instructions, see GitHub Copilot coding agent documentation.\n\n\n\n16.4.2 Benefits and Hazards\nCoding agents are powerful programs that can work autonomously. They can manipulate code, including their own configuration files. They can work on your behalf, but they require careful oversight and control to ensure they serve your interests and that you understand the consequences of their actions.\nCoding agents offer several advantages:\n\nBuilt-in transparency: Coding agents create a clear record of their role in your work through commit history and code suggestions\nContext-aware suggestions: Coding agents understand your codebase and can make contextually relevant suggestions\nIntegration with version control: Using coding agents within GitHub ensures that AI-assisted changes are tracked alongside all other code changes\nInteractive workflow: Coding agents’ interactive nature encourages you to review and modify suggestions rather than blindly accepting them\nAccelerated development: Coding agents can help you write boilerplate code, refactor existing code, and implement common patterns more quickly\nLearning opportunities: Coding agents can suggest approaches or techniques you may not have considered, helping you expand your coding knowledge\n\nHowever, coding agents also come with significant hazards:\n\nOver-reliance: Depending too heavily on coding agents can atrophy your coding skills and understanding\nSubtle bugs: AI-generated code may contain logic errors that are not immediately obvious\nSecurity vulnerabilities: Coding agents may introduce insecure patterns or fail to follow security best practices\nInappropriate solutions: AI may suggest solutions that work but are not optimal for your specific research context or constraints\nHidden biases: Coding agents may perpetuate coding patterns or approaches that reflect biases in their training data\nFalse confidence: Well-formatted, professional-looking code from AI can mask underlying problems and reduce critical review\nWorkflow manipulation risks: Coding agents that modify CI/CD workflows (.github/workflows/*.yml) or setup configurations can inadvertently or maliciously compromise repository security, expose secrets, or execute harmful commands\n\n\n\n16.4.3 Best Practices for Safe and Successful Use\nTo work with coding agents safely and successfully:\n\nMaintain active supervision: Never assume AI-generated code is correct. Review every line critically.\nUnderstand before accepting: If you don’t understand what the code does, don’t use it. Take time to learn or ask a colleague.\nTest thoroughly: AI-generated code must be tested as rigorously as code you write yourself. Don’t skip testing because “the AI wrote it.”\nStart small: Begin with small, well-defined tasks to build confidence and understanding of the agent’s capabilities and limitations.\nVerify logic and assumptions: Check that the AI hasn’t made incorrect assumptions about your data, requirements, or scientific context.\nReview for security: Explicitly check for security issues, especially when handling sensitive data or user input.\nIterate and refine: Use coding agents as a starting point, not an endpoint. Refine and improve the generated code.\nMaintain coding practice: Regularly write code yourself to maintain and develop your skills. Don’t let the agent do everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCritical: Exercise Extreme Caution with Workflow Files\n\n\n\nBe especially careful when allowing coding agents to edit GitHub Actions workflows or CI/CD configurations. These files control automated processes that can:\n\nAccess secrets and credentials\nDeploy code to production\nExecute arbitrary commands in your repository\n\nNever allow a coding agent to edit workflow files (especially .github/workflows/*.yml or copilot-setup-step.yml) without thorough manual review. Before approving any workflow run, always check if the workflow files themselves have been modified. Malicious or erroneous changes to workflows can compromise your entire repository and its secrets.\n\n\nWhen using coding agents, work interactively with the AI suggestions: review, modify, and test them rather than accepting them wholesale. This interactive approach helps ensure code quality and deepens your understanding of the code.\nRemember: AI tools are assistants, not replacements for your expertise and judgment. The quality and correctness of your work remains your responsibility.\n\n\n16.4.4 Firewall and Network Configuration\nCoding agents require specific network access to function properly. If a coding agent is running behind a corporate firewall or on a restricted network, you may need to configure allowlists to enable coding agent functionality.\n\n16.4.4.1 Built-in Agent Firewall\nCoding agents run in a GitHub Actions environment with a built-in firewall that limits internet access by default. This firewall helps protect against:\n\nData exfiltration\nAccidental leaks of sensitive information\nExecution of malicious instructions\n\nBy default, the agent’s firewall allows access to:\n\nCommon OS package repositories (Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc.)\nPopular container registries (Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, AWS ECR, etc.)\nLanguage-specific package registries (npm, PyPI, Maven, RubyGems, etc.)\nCommon certificate authorities for SSL validation\n\nFor the complete list of allowed hosts, see the Copilot allowlist reference.\n\n\n16.4.4.2 Customizing Agent Firewall Settings\nIn your repository’s “Coding agent” settings page, you can:\n\nAdd custom hosts to the allowlist (for internal dependencies or additional registries)\nOpt out of the default recommended allowlist for stricter security\nDisable the firewall entirely (not recommended)\n\nIf a coding agent’s request is blocked by the firewall, a warning will be added to the pull request or comment, detailing the blocked address and the command that triggered it.\nFor more information, see Customizing or disabling the firewall for GitHub Copilot coding agent.\n\n\n\n16.4.5 When to use a coding agent\nCoding agent sessions are currently1 considered “premium requests”, which are limited resources; see https://github.com/features/copilot/plans for details. So, use coding agents sparingly. Use them for complex changes that would be difficult or time-consuming for you to complete by hand. Coding agents also take time to get configured for work, every time you make a request. See https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment#preinstalling-tools-or-dependencies-in-copilots-environment for ways to reduce that startup time, but it will never be 0. If you can complete the task faster than the coding agent can, you should probably do it yourself.\nAlso, the less we practice, the weaker our skills get, and the harder it is for us to supervise the agents and make sure they are actually doing what we want it to do, the way we want it to do it. You should exercise your own coding skills regularly, just like you would for any other skill you want to maintain.\n\n\n16.4.6 Editing with .docx files\nGitHub Copilot coding agents can read Microsoft Word (.docx) files, including tracked changes and comments. This enables a hybrid editing workflow where:\n\nLab members can export Quarto content to Word format for review\nReviewers can make edits, add tracked changes, and insert comments in Word\nCoding agents can read the .docx file and translate the edits back to Quarto format\n\nWhen using this workflow, make sure to explicitly instruct the coding agent to:\n\nExamine and apply all tracked changes in the .docx file\nRead and address all comments in the .docx file\nTranslate edits from Word formatting to appropriate Quarto/markdown syntax\n\nThis approach makes it easier for collaborators who are more comfortable with Word to contribute to the lab manual while maintaining the source files in Quarto format.",

See a colorblind-friendly palette here, a neat palette generator with colorblind options here, and an article on why this matters here\nAre colors/shapes/line types defined in a legend?\nAre the legends and other labels easy to understand with minimal abbreviations?\nIf there is overplotting, is transparency used to show overlapping data?\nAre 95% confidence intervals or other measures of precision shown, if applicable?",
