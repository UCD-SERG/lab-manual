Writing is a powerful tool for clarifying your thoughts,
even before you start searching for answers.
When questions or ideas come up,
it's good practice to write them down immediately—this helps you:

- Organize your thoughts and identify what you actually need to know
- Articulate the problem more precisely
- Often realize the answer yourself through the process of writing

As Leslie Lamport,
a Turing Award winner and computer scientist,
states:
"If you think you understand something,
and don't write down your ideas,
you only think you're thinking" [@lamport2019think].

**Best practice:**
Don't wait for meetings to ask questions.
As soon as a question comes up,
write it out in Teams.
This benefits both you (by clarifying your thinking) and the team
(by getting the conversation started earlier).
