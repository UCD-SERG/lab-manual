## Using AI tools

AI-powered coding assistants can be valuable tools for accelerating your work, but they require careful and responsible use. Lab members who use AI tools must adhere to the following guidelines:

### Responsibility for validation

**You are fully responsible for checking and validating all AI-generated code and content.** AI tools can make mistakes, generate insecure code, produce incorrect logic, or suggest approaches that are inappropriate for our specific research context. Before using any AI-generated code:

- Carefully review the code to ensure you understand what it does
- Test the code thoroughly to verify it works as expected
- Verify that the logic is appropriate for your specific use case
- Check that the code follows our lab's coding standards and best practices
- Ensure the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities or data privacy issues

Never blindly copy and paste AI-generated code without understanding it. If you don't understand what the AI has suggested, take the time to learn or ask a colleague for help.

### Disclosure of AI use

**You must clearly state whenever you have used AI tools in your work.** This is essential for transparency and reproducibility. Specifically:

- In code comments, note when AI tools were used to generate or significantly modify code
- In commit messages, mention if AI tools assisted with the changes
- In manuscripts and reports, acknowledge AI tool usage in the methods or acknowledgments section
- In presentations, disclose AI assistance when relevant

Example code comment:
```
# The following function was generated with assistance from GitHub Copilot
# and has been reviewed and tested to ensure correctness
```

### Recommended tools

We recommend using **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** for AI-assisted coding. GitHub Copilot offers several advantages:

- **Built-in transparency**: When used through GitHub's [Coding Agent interface](https://github.com/features/copilot/agents), Copilot creates a clear record of its role in your work through commit history and code suggestions
- **Context-aware suggestions**: Copilot understands your codebase and can make contextually relevant suggestions
- **Integration with version control**: Using Copilot within GitHub ensures that AI-assisted changes are tracked alongside all other code changes
- **Interactive workflow**: Copilot's interactive nature encourages you to review and modify suggestions rather than blindly accepting them

When using GitHub Copilot or similar tools, work interactively with the AI suggestions—review, modify, and test them rather than accepting them wholesale. This interactive approach helps ensure code quality and deepens your understanding of the code.

Remember: AI tools are assistants, not replacements for your expertise and judgment. The quality and correctness of your work remains your responsibility.
