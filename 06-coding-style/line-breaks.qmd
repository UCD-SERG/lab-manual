**Blank Lines Before Lists**

Always include a blank line before starting a bullet list or numbered list in markdown/Quarto documents. This ensures proper rendering and readability.

**Correct:**
```markdown
Here are the requirements:

- First item
- Second item
```

**Incorrect:**
```markdown
Here are the requirements:
- First item
- Second item
```

Here's what happens if you don't add the blank line:

Here are the requirements:
- First item
- Second item

**Line Breaks in Code**

- For `ggplot` calls and `dplyr` pipelines, do not crowd single lines. Here are some nontrivial examples of "beautiful" pipelines, where beauty is defined by coherence:

```r
# Example 1
school_names = list(
  OUSD_school_names = absentee_all |>
    filter(dist.n == 1) |>
    pull(school) |>
    unique |>
    sort,

  WCCSD_school_names = absentee_all |>
    filter(dist.n == 0) |>
    pull(school) |>
    unique |>
    sort
)
```

```r
# Example 2
absentee_all = fread(file = raw_data_path) |>
  mutate(program = case_when(schoolyr %in% pre_program_schoolyrs ~ 0,
                             schoolyr %in% program_schoolyrs ~ 1)) |>
  mutate(period = case_when(schoolyr %in% pre_program_schoolyrs ~ 0,
                            schoolyr %in% LAIV_schoolyrs ~ 1,
                            schoolyr %in% IIV_schoolyrs ~ 2)) |>
  filter(schoolyr != "2017-18")
```

And of a complex `ggplot` call:
  
```r
# Example 3
ggplot(data=data) +
  
  aes(x=.data[["year"]], y=.data[["rd"]], group=.data[[group]]) +

  geom_point(mapping = aes(col = .data[[group]], shape = .data[[group]]),
             position=position_dodge(width=0.2),
             size=2.5) +

  geom_errorbar(mapping = aes(ymin=.data[["lb"]], ymax= .data[["ub"]], col= .data[[group]]),
                position=position_dodge(width=0.2),
                width=0.2) +

  geom_point(position=position_dodge(width=0.2),
             size=2.5) +

  geom_errorbar(mapping=aes(ymin=lb, ymax=ub),
                position=position_dodge(width=0.2),
                width=0.1) +

  scale_y_continuous(limits=limits,
                     breaks=breaks,
                     labels=breaks) +

  scale_color_manual(std_legend_title,values=cols,labels=legend_label) +
  scale_shape_manual(std_legend_title,values=shapes, labels=legend_label) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, linetype="dashed") +
  xlab("Program year") +
  ylab(yaxis_lab) +
  theme_complete_bw() +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12)) +
  ggtitle(title)
```

  Imagine (or perhaps mournfully recall) the mess that can occur when you don't strictly style a complicated `ggplot` call. Trying to fix bugs and ensure your code is working can be a nightmare. Now imagine trying to do it with the same code 6 months after you've written it. Invest the time now and reap the rewards as the code practically explains itself, line by line.
