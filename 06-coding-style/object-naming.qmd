Use descriptive names that are both expressive and explicit. Being verbose is useful and easy in the age of autocompletion:

```r
# Good
vaccination_coverage_2017_18
absentee_flu_residuals

# Less good
vaxcov_1718
flu_res
```

Prefer nouns for objects and verbs for functions:

```r
# Good
clean_data <- prep_study_data(raw_data)  # verb for function, noun for object

# Less clear
data <- process(input)
```

Use `snake_case` for all variable and function names. Avoid using `.` in names (as in base R's `read.csv()`), as this goes against best practices in modern R and other languages. Modern packages like `readr::read_csv()` follow this convention.
