The `here` package helps manage file paths in projects by automatically finding the project root and building paths relative to it.

This solves the problem of different working directory paths across collaborators. For example, one person might have the project at `/home/oski/Some-R-Project` while another has it at `/home/bear/R-Code/Some-R-Project`. The `here` package handles this automatically.

```r
library(here)

# Automatically finds project root and builds paths
data <- readr::read_csv(here("data-raw", "survey.csv"))
saveRDS(results, here("inst", "analyses", "results.rds"))
```

This works regardless of where collaborators clone the repository. For more details, see the [here package vignette](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here).
