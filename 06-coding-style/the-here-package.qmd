The `here` package helps manage file paths in projects by automatically finding the project root and building paths relative to it.

```r
library(here)

# Automatically finds project root and builds paths
data <- readr::read_csv(here("data-raw", "survey.csv"))
saveRDS(results, here("inst", "analyses", "results.rds"))
```

This solves the problem of different working directory paths across collaborators. 
For example, one person might have the project at `/home/oski/Some-R-Project` while another has it at `/home/bear/R-Code/Some-R-Project`. 
The `here` package handles this automatically.

This works regardless of where collaborators clone the repository.
