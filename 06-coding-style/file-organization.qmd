Just as your data "flows" through your project, code should flow naturally through files in the package structure:

1. **In `R/` files**: Put reusable functions with roxygen2 documentation
2. **In vignettes**: Put narrative analysis with calls to those functions
3. **In `data-raw/`**: Put scripts that create data objects saved to `data/`
4. **In `inst/analyses/`**: Put analyses using restricted data
