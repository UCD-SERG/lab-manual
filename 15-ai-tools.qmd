# Use of AI

AI-powered coding assistants can be valuable tools for accelerating your work, but they require careful and responsible use. Lab members who use AI tools must adhere to the following guidelines:

## Responsibility for validation

**You are fully responsible for checking and validating all AI-generated code and content.** AI tools can make mistakes, generate insecure code, produce incorrect logic, or suggest approaches that are inappropriate for our specific research context. Before using any AI-generated code:

- Carefully review the code to ensure you understand what it does
- Test the code thoroughly to verify it works as expected
- Verify that the logic is appropriate for your specific use case
- Check that the code follows our lab's coding standards and best practices
- Ensure the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities or data privacy issues

Never blindly copy and paste AI-generated code without understanding it. If you don't understand what the AI has suggested, take the time to learn or ask a colleague for help.

## Disclosure of AI use

**You must clearly state whenever you have used AI tools in your work.** This is essential for transparency and reproducibility. Specifically:

- In code comments, note when AI tools were used to generate or significantly modify code
- In commit messages, mention if AI tools assisted with the changes
- In manuscripts and reports, acknowledge AI tool usage in the methods or acknowledgments section
- In presentations, disclose AI assistance when relevant

Example code comment:
```
# The following function was generated with assistance from GitHub Copilot
# and has been reviewed and tested to ensure correctness
```

## Attribution of sources

**When using AI tools to generate content that borrows from or adapts existing sources, you must ensure proper attribution.** 
AI tools sometimes paraphrase or adapt content from documentation, guides, or other resources without clearly indicating the original source. 
It is your responsibility to:

- Ask the AI tool to identify and properly cite sources when it borrows or adapts content
- Verify that any content the AI generates includes appropriate citations
- Add citations yourself if the AI fails to do so
- Follow appropriate attribution practices for the type of content (code comments, documentation, academic writing, etc.)

When instructing AI tools to create documentation or written content, explicitly request that they provide proper attribution for any borrowed or adapted material. 
For example: "Please quote from and paraphrase [source], with proper attribution" rather than simply asking it to summarize information on a topic.

## Coding Agents

We recommend using **[Coding Agents](https://github.com/features/copilot/agents)** 
for AI-assisted coding. 
Coding Agents offer several advantages:

- **Built-in transparency**: Coding agents create a clear record of their role in your work through commit history and code suggestions
- **Context-aware suggestions**: Coding agents understand your codebase and can make contextually relevant suggestions
- **Integration with version control**: Using Coding agents within GitHub ensures that AI-assisted changes are tracked alongside all other code changes
- **Interactive workflow**: Coding agents' interactive nature encourages you to review and modify suggestions rather than blindly accepting them

When using coding agents, work interactively with the AI suggestions:
review, modify, and test them rather than accepting them wholesale. 
This interactive approach helps ensure code quality and deepens your understanding of the code.

Remember: AI tools are assistants, not replacements for your expertise and judgment. 
The quality and correctness of your work remains your responsibility.

### When to use a coding agent

Coding agent sessions are currently^[2026-01-10] considered
"premium requests", which are limited resources; 
see <https://github.com/features/copilot/plans> for details.
So, use coding agents sparingly.
Use them for complex changes that would be difficult or time-consuming
for you to complete by hand.
Coding agents also take time to get configured for work,
every time you make a request.
See <https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment#preinstalling-tools-or-dependencies-in-copilots-environment> for ways to reduce that startup time,
but it will never be 0.

If you can complete the task faster the coding agent can, 
you should probably do it yourself.

Also, less we practice, the weaker our skills get,
and the harder it is for us to supervise the agents
and make sure they are actually doing what we want it to do,
the way we want it to do it.
You should exercise your own coding skills regularly,
just like you would for any other skill you want to maintain.
