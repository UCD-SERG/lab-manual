# Use of AI

AI-powered coding assistants can be valuable tools for accelerating your work, but they require careful and responsible use. Lab members who use AI tools must adhere to the following guidelines:

## Responsibility for validation

**You are fully responsible for checking and validating all AI-generated code and content.** AI tools can make mistakes, generate insecure code, produce incorrect logic, or suggest approaches that are inappropriate for our specific research context. Before using any AI-generated code:

- Carefully review the code to ensure you understand what it does
- Test the code thoroughly to verify it works as expected
- Verify that the logic is appropriate for your specific use case
- Check that the code follows our lab's coding standards and best practices
- Ensure the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities or data privacy issues

Never blindly copy and paste AI-generated code without understanding it. If you don't understand what the AI has suggested, take the time to learn or ask a colleague for help.

## Disclosure of AI use

**You must clearly state whenever you have used AI tools in your work.** This is essential for transparency and reproducibility. Specifically:

- In code comments, note when AI tools were used to generate or significantly modify code
- In commit messages, mention if AI tools assisted with the changes
- In manuscripts and reports, acknowledge AI tool usage in the methods or acknowledgments section
- In presentations, disclose AI assistance when relevant

Example code comment:
```
# The following function was generated with assistance from GitHub Copilot
# and has been reviewed and tested to ensure correctness
```

## Attribution of sources

**When using AI tools to generate content that borrows from or adapts existing sources, you must ensure proper attribution.** 
AI tools sometimes paraphrase or adapt content from documentation, guides, or other resources without clearly indicating the original source. 
It is your responsibility to:

- Ask the AI tool to identify and properly cite sources when it borrows or adapts content
- Verify that any content the AI generates includes appropriate citations
- Add citations yourself if the AI fails to do so
- Follow appropriate attribution practices for the type of content (code comments, documentation, academic writing, etc.)

When instructing AI tools to create documentation or written content, explicitly request that they provide proper attribution for any borrowed or adapted material. 
For example: "Please quote from and paraphrase [source], with proper attribution" rather than simply asking it to summarize information on a topic.

## Coding Agents

We recommend using **[Coding Agents](https://github.com/features/copilot/agents)** 
for AI-assisted coding. 

### Benefits and Hazards

Like the [Agents in the Matrix films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_(The_Matrix)), 
coding agents are powerful programs; 
coding agents can manipulate your code, including their own configuration files.
They can work on your behalf,
but they require careful oversight and control to ensure they serve your interests.

Coding agents offer several advantages:

- **Built-in transparency**: Coding agents create a clear record of their role in your work through commit history and code suggestions
- **Context-aware suggestions**: Coding agents understand your codebase and can make contextually relevant suggestions
- **Integration with version control**: Using coding agents within GitHub ensures that AI-assisted changes are tracked alongside all other code changes
- **Interactive workflow**: Coding agents' interactive nature encourages you to review and modify suggestions rather than blindly accepting them
- **Accelerated development**: Coding agents can help you write boilerplate code, refactor existing code, and implement common patterns more quickly
- **Learning opportunities**: Coding agents can suggest approaches or techniques you may not have considered, helping you expand your coding knowledge

However, coding agents also come with significant hazards:

- **Over-reliance**: Depending too heavily on coding agents can atrophy your coding skills and understanding
- **Subtle bugs**: AI-generated code may contain logic errors that are not immediately obvious
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Coding agents may introduce insecure patterns or fail to follow security best practices
- **Inappropriate solutions**: AI may suggest solutions that work but are not optimal for your specific research context or constraints
- **Hidden biases**: Coding agents may perpetuate coding patterns or approaches that reflect biases in their training data
- **False confidence**: Well-formatted, professional-looking code from AI can mask underlying problems and reduce critical review
- **Workflow manipulation risks**: Coding agents that modify CI/CD workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) or setup configurations can inadvertently or maliciously compromise repository security, expose secrets, or execute harmful commands

### Best Practices for Safe and Successful Use

To work with coding agents safely and successfully:

1. **Maintain active supervision**: Never assume AI-generated code is correct. Review every line critically.

2. **Understand before accepting**: If you don't understand what the code does, don't use it. Take time to learn or ask a colleague.

3. **Test thoroughly**: AI-generated code must be tested as rigorously as code you write yourself. Don't skip testing because "the AI wrote it."

4. **Start small**: Begin with small, well-defined tasks to build confidence and understanding of the agent's capabilities and limitations.

5. **Verify logic and assumptions**: Check that the AI hasn't made incorrect assumptions about your data, requirements, or scientific context.

6. **Review for security**: Explicitly check for security issues, especially when handling sensitive data or user input.

7. **Iterate and refine**: Use coding agents as a starting point, not an endpoint. Refine and improve the generated code.

8. **Maintain coding practice**: Regularly write code yourself to maintain and develop your skills. Don't let the agent do everything.

9. **Exercise extreme caution with workflow files**: Be especially careful when allowing coding agents to edit GitHub Actions workflows or CI/CD configurations. These files control automated processes that can:
   - Access secrets and credentials
   - Deploy code to production
   - Execute arbitrary commands in your repository
   
   **Never** allow a coding agent to edit workflow files (especially `.github/workflows/*.yml` or `copilot-setup-step.yml`) without thorough manual review. Before approving any workflow run, always check if the workflow files themselves have been modified. Malicious or erroneous changes to workflows can compromise your entire repository and its secrets.

When using coding agents, work interactively with the AI suggestions:
review, modify, and test them rather than accepting them wholesale. 
This interactive approach helps ensure code quality and deepens your understanding of the code.

Remember: AI tools are assistants, not replacements for your expertise and judgment. 
The quality and correctness of your work remains your responsibility.

### Firewall and Network Configuration

GitHub Copilot coding agents require specific network access to function properly. If you're working behind a corporate firewall or on a restricted network, you may need to configure allowlists to enable coding agent functionality.

#### Built-in Agent Firewall

Coding agents run in a GitHub Actions environment with a built-in firewall that limits internet access by default. This firewall helps protect against:

- Data exfiltration
- Accidental leaks of sensitive information
- Execution of malicious instructions

By default, the agent's firewall allows access to:

- Common OS package repositories (Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc.)
- Popular container registries (Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, AWS ECR, etc.)
- Language-specific package registries (npm, PyPI, Maven, RubyGems, etc.)
- Common certificate authorities for SSL validation

For the complete list of allowed hosts, see the [Copilot allowlist reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-allowlist-reference).

#### Corporate Firewall Requirements

If your organization uses a corporate firewall, network administrators should allow the following domains (over HTTPS, port 443):

- `github.com`
- `api.github.com`
- `copilot-proxy.githubusercontent.com`
- `*.githubcopilot.com`
- `*.business.githubcopilot.com` (for Copilot Business)
- `*.enterprise.githubcopilot.com` (for Copilot Enterprise)
- `*.githubusercontent.com` (for accessing GitHub-hosted content)
- `*.s3.amazonaws.com` (for GitHub user-uploaded content)

Note that some Copilot features use WebSockets, so ensure `copilot-proxy.githubusercontent.com` allows WebSocket traffic.

#### Customizing Agent Firewall Settings

In your repository's "Coding agent" settings page, you can:

- Add custom hosts to the allowlist (for internal dependencies or additional registries)
- Opt out of the default recommended allowlist for stricter security
- Disable the firewall entirely (not recommended)

If a coding agent's request is blocked by the firewall, a warning will be added to the pull request or comment, detailing the blocked address and the command that triggered it.

For more information, see [Customizing or disabling the firewall for GitHub Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-firewall).

### When to use a coding agent

Coding agent sessions are currently^[2026-01-10] considered
"premium requests", which are limited resources; 
see <https://github.com/features/copilot/plans> for details.
So, use coding agents sparingly.
Use them for complex changes that would be difficult or time-consuming
for you to complete by hand.
Coding agents also take time to get configured for work,
every time you make a request.
See <https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment#preinstalling-tools-or-dependencies-in-copilots-environment> for ways to reduce that startup time,
but it will never be 0.
If you can complete the task faster than the coding agent can, 
you should probably do it yourself.

Also, the less we practice, the weaker our skills get,
and the harder it is for us to supervise the agents
and make sure they are actually doing what we want it to do,
the way we want it to do it.
You should exercise your own coding skills regularly,
just like you would for any other skill you want to maintain.
