## The here Package

The `here` package helps manage file paths in projects:

```r
library(here)

# Automatically finds project root and builds paths
data <- readr::read_csv(here("data-raw", "survey.csv"))
saveRDS(results, here("inst", "analyses", "results.rds"))
```

This works regardless of where collaborators clone the repository.
