## Order Files and Directories
This makes the jumble of alphabetized filenames much more coherent and places similar code and files next to one another. This also helps us understand how data flows from start to finish and allows us to easily map a script to its output (i.e. `2 - Analysis/1 - Absentee-Mean/1-absentee-mean-primary.R` => `5 - Results/1 - Absentee-Mean/1-absentee-mean-primary.RDS`). If you take nothing else away from this guide, this is the single most helpful suggestion to make your workflow more coherent. Often the particular order of files will be in flux until an analysis is close to completion. At that time it is important to review file order and naming and reproduce everything prior to drafting a manuscript.
