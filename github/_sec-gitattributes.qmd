GitHub uses a tool called [Linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/) to detect languages in your repository and generate language statistics.
You can customize how certain files are treated by GitHub
using a `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repository.
This is particularly useful for marking generated files,
documentation,
or vendored code that shouldn't count toward your repository's language statistics.

### The `linguist-generated` Attribute

One of the most useful attributes is `linguist-generated`,
which marks files as generated code.
Files marked this way are:

- **Excluded from language statistics** - they won't affect your repository's language breakdown
- **Hidden by default in diffs** - making pull request reviews cleaner and more focused on actual code changes

Common use cases for `linguist-generated` include:

- Compiled or minified files (e.g., `*.min.js`, `*.min.css`)
- Auto-generated documentation files
- Files generated by build tools or code generators
- Lock files that are updated automatically

For more details,
see the [Generated code documentation](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/docs/overrides.md#generated-code).

### Using `.gitattributes`

Create a `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repository and add patterns for files you want to mark as generated:

```text
# Mark minified JavaScript as generated
*.min.js linguist-generated

# Mark search index as generated
search/index.json linguist-generated

# Mark compiled CSS as generated
dist/styles.css linguist-generated
```

To unmark a file that would normally be considered generated:

```text
# Don't treat bootstrap as generated
bootstrap.min.css -linguist-generated
```

The `.gitattributes` file uses the same pattern matching rules as `.gitignore`.
For more details,
see the [pattern format documentation](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format)
and the [Using gitattributes guide](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/docs/overrides.md#using-gitattributes).

### Other Useful Linguist Attributes

Beyond `linguist-generated`, you can use several other attributes:

- `linguist-vendored` - Marks vendored code (libraries you didn't write) to exclude from stats ([documentation](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/docs/overrides.md#vendored-code))
- `linguist-documentation` - Marks documentation files to exclude from stats ([documentation](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/docs/overrides.md#documentation))
- `linguist-detectable` - Forces a file type to be included in language stats (useful for data or prose files) ([documentation](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/docs/overrides.md#detectable))
- `linguist-language=<name>` - Overrides the detected language for syntax highlighting ([documentation](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/docs/overrides.md#using-gitattributes))

**Example `.gitattributes` file:**

```text
# Exclude vendored dependencies
vendor/* linguist-vendored

# Exclude generated files
*.generated.ts linguist-generated
dist/* linguist-generated

# Mark documentation
docs/* linguist-documentation

# Force R Markdown files to be detected
*.Rmd linguist-detectable
```
