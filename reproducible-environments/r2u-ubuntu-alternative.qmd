For users working on Ubuntu Linux systems,
[r2u](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/) provides an alternative approach to package management
that complements or replaces `renv` in certain workflows.

**What is r2u?**

r2u integrates R package installation with Ubuntu's `apt` package manager,
providing pre-compiled binary packages for all CRAN packages.
This integration offers several advantages over traditional R package installation:

- **Fast installation**: Binary packages install in seconds, not minutes
- **Automatic dependency resolution**: System dependencies are handled automatically
- **System-level integration**: Packages integrate with Ubuntu's package management
- **No compilation required**: Eliminates the need for build tools and compilers

**Supported Ubuntu versions (as of early 2025):**

- Ubuntu 24.04 "noble" (amd64 and arm64)
- Ubuntu 22.04 "jammy" (amd64)
- Ubuntu 20.04 "focal" (amd64, archived - no new updates)

**When to use r2u vs. renv:**

- **Use r2u when**: You work primarily on Ubuntu systems, want fast package installation, or need system-level package management
- **Use renv when**: You need cross-platform reproducibility, work on macOS/Windows, or require project-specific package libraries
- **Use both when**: You want fast installation on Ubuntu while maintaining reproducibility through renv lockfiles

**Basic setup:**

r2u requires a one-time system setup.
See the [r2u website](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/) for detailed installation instructions.

Once configured,
R's `install.packages()` automatically uses binary packages from r2u,
making package installation much faster.

**Docker containers:**

The Rocker Project provides `rocker/r2u` Docker containers with r2u pre-configured,
ideal for reproducible containerized workflows.
