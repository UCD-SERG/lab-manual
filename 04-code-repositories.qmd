# Code repositories

Adapted by UCD-SeRG team from [original by Kunal Mishra, Jade Benjamin-Chung, and Stephanie Djajadi](https://jadebc.github.io/lab-manual/code-repositories.html)

Each study has at least one code repository that typically holds R code, shell scripts with Unix code, and research outputs (results .RDS files, tables, figures). Repositories may also include datasets. This chapter outlines how to organize these files. Adhering to a standard format makes it easier for us to efficiently collaborate across projects.
