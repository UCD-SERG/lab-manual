Generally we recommend using nouns for objects and verbs for functions. This is because functions are performing actions, while objects are not. 

Try to make your variable names both more expressive and more explicit. Being a bit more verbose is useful and easy in the age of autocompletion! For example, instead of naming a variable `vaxcov_1718`, try naming it `vaccination_coverage_2017_18`. Similarly, `flu_res` could be named `absentee_flu_residuals`, making your code more readable and explicit.

We recommend you use **Snake_Case**.  

- Base R allows `.` in variable names and functions (such as `read.csv()`), but this goes against best practices for variable naming in many other coding languages. For consistency's sake, `snake_case` has been adopted across languages, and modern packages and functions typically use it (i.e. `readr::read_csv()`). As a very general rule of thumb, if a package you're using doesn't use `snake_case`, there may be an updated version or more modern package that _does_, bringing with it the variety of performance improvements and bug fixes inherent in more mature and modern software.

- **Note**: you may also see `camelCase` throughout the R code you come across. This is _okay_ but not ideal -- try to stay consistent across all your code with `snake_case`.

- **Note**: again, its also worth noting there's nothing inherently wrong with using `.` in variable names, just that it goes against style best practices that are cropping up in data science, so its worth getting rid of these bad habits now.
