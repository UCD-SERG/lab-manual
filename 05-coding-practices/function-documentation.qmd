Every function you write must include a header to document its purpose, inputs, and outputs.  For any reproducible workflows, they are essential, because R is dynamically typed. This means, you can pass a `string` into an argument that is meant to be a `data.table`, or a `list` into an argument meant for a `tibble`. It is the responsibility of a function's author to document what each argument is meant to do and its basic type. This is an example for documenting a function (inspired by [JavaDocs](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#format) and R's [Plumber API docs](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/10/23/rstudio-1-2-preview-plumber-integration/)):

# Documentation: calc_fluseas_mean
# Usage: calc_fluseas_mean(data, yname)
# Description: Make a dataframe with rows for flu season and site
# and the number of patients with an outcome, the total patients,
# and the percent of patients with the outcome

# Args/Options:
# data: a data frame with variables flu_season, site, studyID, and yname
# yname: a string for the outcome name
# silent: a boolean specifying whether the function shouldn't output anything to the console (DEFAULT: TRUE)

# Returns: the dataframe as described above
# Output: prints the data frame described above if silent is not True

calc_fluseas_mean <- function(data, yname, silent = TRUE) {

The header tells you what the function does, its various inputs, and how you might go about using the function to do what you want. Also notice that all optional arguments (i.e. ones with pre-specified defaults) follow arguments that require user input.

As someone trying to call a function, it is possible to access a function's documentation (and internal code) by `CMD-Left-Click`ing the function's name in RStudio

Depending on how important your function is, the complexity of your function code, and the complexity of different types of data in your project, you can also add "type-checking" to your function with the `assertthat::assert_that()` function. You can, for example, `assert_that(is.data.frame(statistical_input))`, which will ensure that collaborators or reviewers of your project attempting to use your function are using it in the way that it is intended by calling it with (at the minimum) the correct type of arguments. You can extend this to ensure that certain assumptions regarding the inputs are fulfilled as well (i.e. that `time_column`, `location_column`, `value_column`, and `population_column` all exist within the `statistical_input` tibble).
