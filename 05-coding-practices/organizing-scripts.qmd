## Organizing scripts

Just as your data "flows" through your project, data should flow naturally through a script. Very generally, you want to:

1. describe the work completed in the script in a comment header
2. source your configuration file (`0-config.R`) 
3. load all your data 
4. do all your analysis/computation 
5. save your data. 

Each of these sections should be "chunked together" using comments. See [this file](https://github.com/kmishra9/Flu-Absenteeism/blob/master/Master's%20Thesis%20-%20Spatial%20Epidemiology%20of%20Influenza/2a%20-%20Statistical-Inputs.R) for a good example of how to cleanly organize a file in a way that follows this "flow" and functionally separate pieces of code that are doing different things.
