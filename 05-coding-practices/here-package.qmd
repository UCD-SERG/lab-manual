The `here` package is one great R package that helps multiple collaborators deal with the mess that is working directories within an R project structure. Let's say we have an R project at the path `/home/oski/Some-R-Project`. My collaborator might clone the repository and work with it at some other path, such as  `/home/bear/R-Code/Some-R-Project`. Dealing with working directories and paths explicitly can be a very large pain, and as you might imagine, setting up a Config with paths requires those paths to flexibly work for all contributors to a project. This is where the `here` package comes in and this a [great vignette describing it](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here).
