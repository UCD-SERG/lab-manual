Quarto books let you author entire books (or course notes, manuals, dissertations, etc.) in markdown.
Quarto books are ideal for documentation,
tutorials,
lab manuals,
and other long-form content.

### Creating a Quarto Book

**Starting from a template (recommended):**

Using a template is the fastest way to get started with a Quarto book,
as it provides pre-configured settings and examples:

1. **UCD-SeRG Quarto Book Template** - Our recommended template with pre-configured settings for lab publications:
   - Repository: <https://github.com/UCD-SERG/quarto-book-template>
   - Click "Use this template" → "Create a new repository" on GitHub
   - Clone your new repository and start editing

2. **Coatless Tutorials Quarto Book Template** - Another frequently-used template with helpful examples:
   - Repository: <https://github.com/coatless-tutorials/quarto-book-template>
   - Includes examples of common Quarto book features

**Starting from scratch:**

If you prefer to start from scratch,
you can create a new Quarto book project using the Quarto CLI:

```bash
# Create a new Quarto book project
quarto create project book mybook
cd mybook
```

This will create a basic book structure with:

- `_quarto.yml` - configuration file for your book
- `index.qmd` - the home page / preface
- Sample chapter files
- `references.qmd` - bibliography/references page

### Building and Previewing

Once you have a Quarto book project,
you can build and preview it:

```bash
# Render the entire book
quarto render

# Preview with live reload (recommended during development)
quarto preview
```

The `quarto preview` command starts a local web server and automatically refreshes the preview whenever you save changes to your files.

### Book Structure

A typical Quarto book is organized as follows:

**`_quarto.yml`:**
The main configuration file that defines:

- Book metadata (title, author, date)
- Chapter order
- Output formats (HTML, PDF, ePub, etc.)
- Styling and theme
- Navigation options

**Chapter files:**
Individual `.qmd` files for each chapter.
These are listed in the `chapters` section of `_quarto.yml`.

**Parts:**
You can organize chapters into parts for better structure:

```yaml
book:
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - part: "Getting Started"
      chapters:
        - intro.qmd
        - basics.qmd
    - part: "Advanced Topics"
      chapters:
        - advanced.qmd
```

### Book Features
