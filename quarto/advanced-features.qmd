### Cross-References

Quarto provides a powerful cross-reference system for figures,
tables,
equations,
and sections.
Cross-references automatically number your content and create clickable links in HTML and PDF output.

**Required label prefixes:**

- Figures: `#fig-` (e.g., `#fig-workflow-diagram`)
- Tables: `#tbl-` (e.g., `#tbl-summary-stats`)
- Equations: `#eq-` (e.g., `#eq-regression-model`)
- Sections: `#sec-` (e.g., `#sec-introduction`)
- Theorems: `#thm-`, Lemmas: `#lem-`, Corollaries: `#cor-`
- Propositions: `#prp-`, Examples: `#exm-`, Exercises: `#exr-`

**For figures (static images):**

```markdown
![Caption text](path/to/image.png){#fig-label}
```

**For code-generated figures:**

````markdown
```{{r}}
#| label: fig-plot-name
#| fig-cap: "Caption text describing the plot"

# R code to generate plot
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
```
````

**For tables (markdown tables):**

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data     | Data     |

: Caption text {#tbl-label}
```

**For code-generated tables:**

````markdown
```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-table-name
#| tbl-cap: "Caption text"

# R code to generate table
knitr::kable(data)
```
````

**Referencing in text:**

- Figures: `@fig-label` produces "Figure X"
- Tables: `@tbl-label` produces "Table X"
- Equations: `@eq-label` produces "Equation X"
- Sections: `@sec-label` produces "Section X"

**Benefits:**

- Automatic numbering of figures, tables, and equations
- Automatic updates when content is reordered
- Clickable cross-references in HTML and PDF output
- Consistent formatting across all output formats
- Better accessibility for screen readers

### Using Includes for Modular Content

Quarto's include feature allows you to decompose large documents into smaller,
more manageable files.
This is particularly useful for books and long documents.

**Basic syntax:**

```markdown
{{</* include path/to/file.qmd */>}}
```

**Benefits:**

1. **Better Git History:**
   When sections are reordered,
   only the main chapter file changes (moving include statements),
   making it immediately clear that content was reorganized rather than edited.

2. **Easier Code Review:**
   Reviewers can see exactly what changed—either the organization (main file) or the content (include file).

3. **Modular Maintenance:**
   Each section lives in its own file,
   making it easier to find and edit specific content,
   reuse sections across chapters,
   and work on different sections simultaneously without merge conflicts.

4. **Clear Structure:**
   The main chapter file becomes a table of contents showing the organization at a glance.

**Recommended pattern:**

Main chapter file (e.g., `05-coding-practices.qmd`):

```markdown
# Coding Practices

## Section Heading

{{</* include coding-practices/section-name.qmd */>}}

## Another Section

{{</* include coding-practices/another-section.qmd */>}}
```

Include files (e.g., `coding-practices/section-name.qmd`):

- Stored in a subdirectory matching the chapter name
- Contains only the content for that section (no heading)
- The heading stays in the main chapter file
- Named descriptively using kebab-case

**Note:** The heading must be in the main file,
followed by a blank line,
then the include statement.
This keeps the document structure clear in the main file.
