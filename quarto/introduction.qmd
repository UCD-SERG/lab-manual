[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that allows you to create documents,
books,
websites,
presentations,
and more.
Quarto provides a unified authoring framework for data science,
combining your code,
its results,
and your prose.
Quarto documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats,
like PDFs,
Word files,
presentations,
and more.

Quarto files are designed to be used in three ways:

1. **For communicating to decision-makers,**
   who want to focus on the conclusions,
   not the code behind the analysis.

2. **For collaborating with other data scientists**
   (including future you!),
   who are interested in both your conclusions,
   and how you reached them (i.e., the code).

3. **As an environment in which to do data science,**
   as a modern-day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did,
   but also what you were thinking.

### Key Features

**Multi-format Output:**
Quarto documents can be rendered into HTML,
PDF,
MS Word,
ePub,
PowerPoint,
Revealjs presentations,
dashboards,
websites,
and books from a single source file.
This allows authors to maintain one document but publish it in multiple formats without rewriting content.

**Rich Markdown Authoring:**
Content is created in markdown,
with support for figures,
tables,
equations (LaTeX),
citations,
cross-references,
and advanced layout features like tabs,
callouts,
and panels.

**Embedded Executable Code:**
Integrate code chunks (R, Python, Julia, Observable JS) that can be executed and the results rendered directly in the document.
This allows for dynamic results,
data analysis,
plots,
and reproducible research workflows.

**Interactivity:**
Add interactive components such as widgets,
tab sets,
and collapsible sections for richer communication with readers.

**Customization:**
Extensive theming and styling options,
including custom CSS and advanced layout controls for polished,
publication-quality output.

**Project Management:**
Organize large projects and integrate with version control tools like Git.
Use Quarto projects to group related documents,
manage dependencies,
and orchestrate rendering.

### Why Quarto?

If you're an R Markdown user,
you might be thinking "Quarto sounds a lot like R Markdown."
You're not wrong!
Quarto unifies the functionality of many packages from the R Markdown ecosystem
(rmarkdown, bookdown, distill, xaringan, etc.)
into a single consistent system as well as extends it with native support for multiple programming languages like Python and Julia in addition to R.
In a way,
Quarto reflects everything that was learned from expanding and supporting the R Markdown ecosystem over a decade.

### Getting Started

To get started with Quarto:

- **Installation:** Quarto CLI is included with RStudio,
  so if you have a recent version of RStudio,
  you already have Quarto.
