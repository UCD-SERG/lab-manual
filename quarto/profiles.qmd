Quarto profiles allow you to customize rendering behavior for different purposes.
A profile is a named set of configuration options that can be activated when rendering.
This is particularly useful when you want to render the same source files in different formats or for different audiences.

### What are Profiles?

Profiles let you maintain multiple `_quarto.yml` configuration files in the same project.
For example,
you might have:

- `_quarto.yml` - default book configuration
- `_quarto-revealjs.yml` - configuration for rendering chapters as slide decks
- `_quarto-print.yml` - configuration optimized for PDF printing

### Example: Rendering Chapters as Slides

A excellent example of using Quarto profiles comes from the [Regression Models for Epidemiology](https://d-morrison.github.io/rme/) course materials by D. Morrison.

The project includes a `_quarto-revealjs.yml` profile that allows each chapter to be compiled as a RevealJS slide deck,
in addition to being part of the book.

To render a single chapter as slides:

```bash
quarto render chapter-name.qmd --profile=revealjs
```

To render all chapters listed in the profile as slides:

```bash
quarto render --profile=revealjs
```

### Creating a Profile

To create a profile:

1. Create a new YAML file named `_quarto-{profile-name}.yml`
2. Include only the configuration options that differ from your default `_quarto.yml`
3. Activate the profile when rendering using `--profile={profile-name}`

**Example profile structure:**

`_quarto-slides.yml`:

```yaml
project:
  type: default
  output-dir: slides

format:
  revealjs:
    theme: serif
    slide-number: true
    preview-links: auto
```

### Common Use Cases

**Multiple output formats:**
Maintain separate configurations for web,
print,
and presentation versions of your content.

**Different audiences:**
Create versions with or without solutions,
technical details,
or instructor notes.

**Development vs. production:**
Use a development profile with faster rendering options during writing,
and a production profile with full features for final output.

**Course materials:**
Render the same content as both a reference book and lecture slides,
as demonstrated in the [RME course](https://d-morrison.github.io/rme/).
