When you set up a workflow,
`usethis` creates a YAML configuration file in `.github/workflows/`.
For example,
`check-standard` creates `.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml`.

This workflow automatically runs when you:

- Push commits to `main` or `master`
- Open or update a pull request

You can view workflow results in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
A status badge is added to your README showing whether checks are passing.
