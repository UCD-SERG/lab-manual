For GitHub Actions workflows running on Ubuntu,
[r2u](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/) provides a faster alternative to installing R packages from source.
r2u offers pre-compiled binary packages for all CRAN packages on Ubuntu,
which can dramatically reduce CI build times.

**Key benefits for CI workflows:**

- **Faster installation**: Binary packages install in seconds rather than minutes
- **Automatic dependency resolution**: All system dependencies are handled by `apt`
- **Complete CRAN coverage**: Over 30,000 CRAN packages available as binaries (as of early 2025)
- **GitHub Actions support**: Easy integration with Ubuntu runners

**Quick example:**

Instead of waiting several minutes for `install.packages("tidyverse")` to compile from source,
r2u can install it as binaries in under 20 seconds.

**How to use r2u in GitHub Actions:**

The r2u project provides Docker containers and setup actions.
For most workflows,
you can use the [r2u setup action](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/github-actions/tree/master/r2u-setup):

```yaml
- name: Setup r2u
  uses: eddelbuettel/github-actions/r2u-setup@master
```

Alternatively,
use the rocker/r2u Docker containers directly in your workflow.

**When to consider r2u:**

- Your workflow installs many R packages
- Build times are a bottleneck in your CI pipeline
- You're running on Ubuntu (focal, jammy, or noble)
- You want to reduce GitHub Actions minutes usage

see the [r2u website](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/).
