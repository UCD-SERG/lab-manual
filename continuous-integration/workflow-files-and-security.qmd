**Important Security Consideration**

Workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.yaml`) have access to repository secrets and can execute code.
Always review workflow files carefully before committing them,
especially if copied from external sources.

See @sec-ai-best-practices for guidance on working with workflow files using AI tools.
:::

The workflow YAML files in `.github/workflows/` are configuration files that tell GitHub Actions:

- When to run (on push, pull request, schedule, etc.)
- What operating systems and R versions to use
- What steps to execute (install dependencies, run checks, etc.)
