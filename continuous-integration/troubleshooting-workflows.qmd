When workflows fail,
check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository for detailed logs.
Common issues include:

- **Test failures**: Your tests found a bug (this is good! fix the bug)
- **Platform-specific issues**: Code works on your machine but not on other platforms
- **Missing dependencies**: System libraries needed for packages aren't installed
- **Linting errors**: Code style issues detected by automated checks
