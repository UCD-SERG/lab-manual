[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is GitHub's built-in automation platform that makes it easy to automate software workflows,
including continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
For R packages,
this means you can automatically test your code,
check for errors,
and deploy documentation every time you push changes to GitHub.

**Key benefits of GitHub Actions:**

- **Automated testing**: Run `R CMD check` across multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and R versions
- **Immediate feedback**: Get notified of problems quickly, when they're easier to fix
- **Better collaboration**: External contributors can see if their changes pass all checks before you review
- **Quality assurance**: Catch platform-specific issues before they reach users
- **Documentation deployment**: Automatically build and deploy your pkgdown website

Even for solo developers,
having automated checks run on different platforms helps avoid the "works on my machine" problem.
