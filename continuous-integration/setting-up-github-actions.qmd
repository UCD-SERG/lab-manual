The easiest way to add GitHub Actions to your R package is using <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/">`{usethis}`</a>.
The tidyverse team maintains a collection of ready-to-use workflows at [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) that handle common R package tasks.

### Essential Workflows

**1. R CMD check (most important):**

```r
usethis::use_github_action("check-standard")
```

This runs `R CMD check` on Linux, macOS, and Windows to ensure your package works across platforms.
If you only set up one workflow, make it this one.

**2. Test coverage:**

```r
usethis::use_github_action("test-coverage")
```

Calculates what percentage of your code is covered by tests and reports to [codecov.io](https://about.codecov.io).

**3. Package website:**

```r
usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")
```

Automatically builds and deploys your pkgdown documentation site to GitHub Pages.

### Interactive Setup

Running `usethis::use_github_action()` without arguments shows a menu of recommended workflows:

```r
usethis::use_github_action()
#> Which action do you want to add? (0 to exit)
#> (See <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples> for other options)
#>
#> 1: check-standard: Run `R CMD check` on Linux, macOS, and Windows
#> 2: test-coverage: Compute test coverage and report to https://about.codecov.io
#> 3: pr-commands: Add /document and /style commands for pull requests
```
