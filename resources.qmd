### Building Quarto Books

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that allows you to create books, websites, presentations, and more.
Quarto books are ideal for documentation, tutorials, lab manuals, and other long-form content.

**Getting Started**

To create a new Quarto book project,
you can start from scratch or use a template:

**Starting from a template (recommended):**

1. **UCD-SeRG Quarto Book Template** - Our recommended template with pre-configured settings for lab publications:
   - Repository: <https://github.com/UCD-SERG/quarto-book-template>
   - Click "Use this template" → "Create a new repository" on GitHub
   - Clone your new repository and start editing

2. **Coatless Tutorials Quarto Book Template** - Another frequently-used template with helpful examples:
   - Repository: <https://github.com/coatless-tutorials/quarto-book-template>
   - Includes examples of common Quarto book features

**Starting from scratch:**

```bash
# Create a new Quarto book project
quarto create project book mybook
cd mybook
```

**Building and previewing:**

```bash
# Render the entire book
quarto render

# Preview with live reload (recommended during development)
quarto preview
```
