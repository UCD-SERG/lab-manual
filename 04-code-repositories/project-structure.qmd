The `data-raw` folder serves as a catch-all for scripts that do not (yet) fit into the package structure described above. The `data-raw` folder should still be organized.
We recommend the following directory structure:

```
0-run-project.sh
0-config.R
1 - Data-Management/
    0-prep-data.sh
    1-prep-cdph-fluseas.R
    2a-prep-absentee.R
    2b-prep-absentee-weighted.R
    3a-prep-absentee-adj.R
    3b-prep-absentee-adj-weighted.R
2 - Analysis/
    0-run-analysis.sh
    1 - Absentee-Mean/
        1-absentee-mean-primary.R
        2-absentee-mean-negative-control.R
        3-absentee-mean-CDC.R
        4-absentee-mean-peakwk.R
        5-absentee-mean-cdph2.R
        6-absentee-mean-cdph3.R
    2 - Absentee-Positivity-Check/
    3 - Absentee-P1/
    4 - Absentee-P2/
3 - Figures/
    0-run-figures.sh
    ...
4 - Tables/
    0-run-tables.sh
    ...
5 - Results/
    1 - Absentee-Mean/
        1-absentee-mean-primary.RDS
        2-absentee-mean-negative-control.RDS
        3-absentee-mean-CDC.RDS
        4-absentee-mean-peakwk.RDS
        5-absentee-mean-cdph2.RDS
        6-absentee-mean-cdph3.RDS
    ...
.gitignore
```

For brevity, not every directory is "expanded", but we can glean some important takeaways from what we _do_ see.
