## `.Rproj` files
An "R Project" can be created within RStudio by going to `File >> New Project`. Depending on where you are with your research, choose the most appropriate option. This will save preferences, working directories, and even the results of running code/data (though I'd recommend starting from scratch each time you open your project, in general). Then, ensure that whenever you are working on that specific research project, you open your created project to enable the full utility of `.Rproj` files. This also automatically sets the directory to the top level of the project.
