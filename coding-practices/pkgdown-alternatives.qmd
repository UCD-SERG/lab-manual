While [`{pkgdown}`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) is the standard tool for creating package documentation websites,
several alternatives exist that may better suit specific needs,
particularly for generating multiple output formats beyond HTML.

#### altdoc

[`{altdoc}`](https://altdoc.etiennebacher.com/) is a flexible alternative that supports multiple documentation frameworks,
including Quarto,
Docsify,
MkDocs,
and Docute.
It is especially useful when you need to generate documentation in multiple formats.

**Key features:**

- Supports multiple documentation frameworks (Quarto, Docsify, MkDocs, Docute)
- Renders Quarto and R Markdown vignettes to HTML websites
- When using Quarto as the framework, vignettes can be authored to support multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX, reveal.js presentations), and Quarto can include download links for alternative formats on the HTML site ([see Quarto documentation on multiple formats](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-multi-format.html))
- Handles function reference pages, README, NEWS, and other standard documentation
- Easy preview and deployment workflow

**Basic usage:**

```r
# Install altdoc
install.packages("altdoc")

# Set up documentation with Quarto
altdoc::setup_docs(tool = "quarto_website")

# Or use other frameworks
# altdoc::setup_docs(tool = "docsify")
# altdoc::setup_docs(tool = "mkdocs")
# altdoc::setup_docs(tool = "docute")

# Render documentation
altdoc::render_docs()

# Preview in browser
altdoc::preview_docs()
```

**When to choose altdoc:**

- You want to use Quarto's modern publishing system for your documentation website
- You need vignettes that can be downloaded in multiple formats (when authored with Quarto's multi-format support)
- You prefer a different documentation framework than pkgdown's Bootstrap-based approach (Docsify, MkDocs, or Docute)
- You need more flexibility in site design and structure

#### pkgsite

[`{pkgsite}`](https://github.com/pachadotdev/pkgsite) provides a minimal,
lightweight alternative to pkgdown,
focusing on simplicity and ease of customization.

**Key features:**

- Minimal CSS framework (no Bootstrap)
- Simple, clean design that is easy to customize
- Similar `build_site()` function to pkgdown
- Lightweight and fast
- Can be published via GitHub Pages or other static site hosts

**Basic usage:**

```r
# Install pkgsite (not on CRAN as of early 2026)
pak::pkg_install("pachadotdev/pkgsite")

# Build and preview site
pkgsite::build_site(preview = TRUE)

# Build with custom URL and lazy rebuilding
pkgsite::build_site(
  url = "https://yourdomain.com",
  lazy = TRUE,
  preview = TRUE
)
```

**When to choose pkgsite:**

- You want a minimal, lightweight documentation site
- You prefer to customize CSS styling from scratch
- You don't need the extensive features of pkgdown
- You want faster build times for simple packages

#### Quarto for Package Documentation

While not a dedicated package documentation tool,
Quarto can be used to create sophisticated documentation websites for R packages,
particularly when combined with custom scripts or tools like [`{ecodown}`](https://github.com/edgararuiz/ecodown) (experimental and intended for internal use).

**Discussion and resources:**

- [Quarto discussion on pkgdown alternative](https://github.com/orgs/quarto-dev/discussions/1591)
- pkgdown itself now supports Quarto vignettes (as of version 2.1.0)

**When to consider Quarto:**

- You want complete control over site structure and design
- You're already using Quarto for other documentation
- You need advanced publishing features beyond what pkgdown offers
- You're comfortable writing custom scripts for function reference extraction

#### Comparison Summary

| Tool     | Complexity | Website Output | Multi-format Support | Customization | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| pkgdown  | Standard  | HTML           | Limited (via Quarto vignettes) | Template-based | Most R packages, standard documentation needs |
| altdoc   | Moderate  | HTML           | Yes (via Quarto-authored vignettes with download links) | Framework-dependent | Quarto-based workflows, flexible frameworks |
| pkgsite  | Minimal   | HTML           | No | High (simple CSS) | Lightweight sites, custom styling |
| Quarto   | Advanced  | HTML (for websites) | Yes (native - can output to PDF, DOCX, reveal.js, EPUB) | Complete | Full control, advanced features |

**Recommendation:**
Use pkgdown for most standard R package documentation needs.
Consider altdoc when you prefer Quarto's publishing system or want flexibility to choose between documentation frameworks (Quarto, Docsify, MkDocs, Docute).
If you choose altdoc with Quarto, you can author vignettes to provide downloadable PDF and DOCX versions alongside the HTML website.
Choose pkgsite for minimalist websites with easy CSS customization.
Use Quarto directly only if you need complete control and are comfortable with more complex setup.
