While [`{pkgdown}`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) is the standard tool for creating package documentation websites,
several alternatives exist that may better suit specific needs,
particularly for generating multiple output formats beyond HTML.

#### altdoc

[`{altdoc}`](https://altdoc.etiennebacher.com/) is a flexible alternative that supports multiple documentation frameworks,
including Quarto,
Docsify,
MkDocs,
and Docute.
It is especially useful when you need to generate documentation in multiple formats.

**Key features:**

- Supports Quarto and R Markdown vignettes
- Can generate HTML websites, PDF documents, DOCX files, and reveal.js presentations
- Provides multiple site generation frameworks to choose from
- Handles function reference pages, README, NEWS, and other standard documentation
- Easy preview and deployment workflow

**Basic usage:**

```r
# Install altdoc
install.packages("altdoc")

# Set up documentation with Quarto
altdoc::setup_docs(tool = "quarto_website")

# Or use other frameworks
# altdoc::setup_docs(tool = "docsify")
# altdoc::setup_docs(tool = "mkdocs")
# altdoc::setup_docs(tool = "docute")

# Render documentation
altdoc::render_docs()

# Preview in browser
altdoc::preview_docs()
```

**When to choose altdoc:**

- You need to generate DOCX or PDF versions of your documentation
- You want to create reveal.js presentations from your vignettes
- You prefer Quarto's modern publishing system
- You need more flexibility in site design and structure
- You want to use a different documentation framework than pkgdown's Bootstrap-based approach

#### pkgsite

[`{pkgsite}`](https://github.com/pachadotdev/pkgsite) provides a minimal,
lightweight alternative to pkgdown,
focusing on simplicity and ease of customization.

**Key features:**

- Minimal CSS framework (no Bootstrap)
- Simple, clean design that is easy to customize
- Similar `build_site()` function to pkgdown
- Lightweight and fast
- Can be published via GitHub Pages or other static site hosts

**Basic usage:**

```r
# Install pkgsite (not on CRAN as of early 2026)
pak::pkg_install("pachadotdev/pkgsite")

# Build and preview site
pkgsite::build_site(preview = TRUE)

# Build with custom URL and lazy rebuilding
pkgsite::build_site(
  url = "https://yourdomain.com",
  lazy = TRUE,
  preview = TRUE
)
```

**When to choose pkgsite:**

- You want a minimal, lightweight documentation site
- You prefer to customize CSS styling from scratch
- You don't need the extensive features of pkgdown
- You want faster build times for simple packages

#### Quarto for Package Documentation

While not a dedicated package documentation tool,
Quarto can be used to create sophisticated documentation websites for R packages,
particularly when combined with custom scripts or tools like [`{ecodown}`](https://github.com/edgararuiz/ecodown) (experimental and intended for internal use).

**Discussion and resources:**

- [Quarto discussion on pkgdown alternative](https://github.com/orgs/quarto-dev/discussions/1591)
- pkgdown itself now supports Quarto vignettes (as of version 2.1.0)

**When to consider Quarto:**

- You want complete control over site structure and design
- You're already using Quarto for other documentation
- You need advanced publishing features beyond what pkgdown offers
- You're comfortable writing custom scripts for function reference extraction

#### Comparison Summary

| Tool     | Complexity | Output Formats | Customization | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| pkgdown  | Standard  | HTML           | Template-based | Most R packages, standard documentation needs |
| altdoc   | Moderate  | HTML, PDF, DOCX, reveal.js | Framework-dependent | Multiple output formats, modern design |
| pkgsite  | Minimal   | HTML           | High (simple CSS) | Lightweight sites, custom styling |
| Quarto   | Advanced  | HTML, PDF, DOCX, reveal.js, EPUB | Complete | Full control, advanced features |

**Recommendation:**
Use pkgdown for most standard R package documentation needs.
Consider altdoc when you need multiple output formats (DOCX, PDF, presentations) or prefer Quarto's publishing system.
Choose pkgsite for minimalist websites with easy CSS customization.
Use Quarto directly only if you need complete control and are comfortable with more complex setup.
