GitHub Actions can automatically comment on pull requests to provide feedback,
status updates,
or deployment previews.
This section compares commonly used actions for managing PR comments,
helping you choose the right tool for your workflow.

#### Common Use Cases

PR comment automation is particularly useful for:

- **CI/CD status updates**: Report test results, build status, or deployment progress
- **Code quality reports**: Post coverage reports, linting results, or security scan findings  
- **Deployment previews**: Share links to preview deployments (e.g., documentation sites, app previews)
- **Bot feedback**: Provide automated feedback without cluttering the PR conversation

#### Comparison of Popular Actions

**[marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment](https://github.com/marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment)**

A widely-used action for creating or updating a single comment per workflow (as of early 2025,
~580 GitHub stars).
Prevents comment spam by updating the same comment each time the workflow runs.

*Key features:*

- **Sticky comments**: Creates or updates a comment identified by a unique header
- **Multiple independent comments**: Different workflows can maintain separate sticky comments using different headers
- **Flexible update modes**: Replace, append, recreate, delete, or hide comments
- **File-based messages**: Load comment content from files for complex templates
- **Works with push events**: Can find and comment on PRs from push triggers (useful for monorepos)

*Typical usage:*

```yaml
- uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
  with:
    header: test-results
    message: |
      ## Test Results
      ```
      ${{ steps.test.outputs.summary }}
      ```
```

*Best for:* Projects needing clean,
updatable status comments without duplicates.
Ideal when you want the same type of information always visible in one place.

**[hasura/comment-progress](https://github.com/hasura/comment-progress)**

Designed for tracking workflow progress with multiple updates as jobs complete.
Similar to how Netlify or SonarCloud bots provide progressive feedback.

*Key features:*

- **Progress tracking**: Update comments as workflow steps complete or fail
- **Identifier-based updates**: Uses a hidden identifier to find and update the correct comment
- **Multiple update modes**: Append to existing comments, recreate, or delete
- **Flexible targets**: Comment on PRs, issues, or specific commits
- **Failure handling**: Optionally fail the workflow and append failure messages

*Typical usage:*

```yaml
- uses: hasura/comment-progress@v2.3.0
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    repository: ${{ github.repository }}
    number: ${{ github.event.number }}
    id: deploy-progress
    message: "Deploy in progress..."
    append: true
```

*Best for:* Long-running workflows where you want to provide incremental status updates as different stages complete.
Good for deployment pipelines or multi-stage builds.

**[thollander/actions-comment-pull-request](https://github.com/thollander/actions-comment-pull-request)**

A simpler,
more straightforward action for posting or updating PR comments.
Good balance of features and ease of use.

*Key features:*

- **Simple comment creation**: Easy to post one-time or updated comments
- **Comment updates**: Find and update existing comments by ID or content
- **Reactions**: Add emoji reactions to comments
- **Comment deletion**: Remove comments when no longer needed
- **Dynamic content**: Supports multi-line messages and environment variables

*Typical usage:*

```yaml
- uses: thollander/actions-comment-pull-request@v2
  with:
    message: |
      ## Deployment Status
      ✅ Successfully deployed to preview environment
      Preview URL: https://preview-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com
```

*Best for:* Straightforward commenting needs without complex update logic.
Good for simple status messages or one-time notifications.

#### Security Considerations

::: {.callout-warning}
**Important: PR Comment Permissions**

PR comment actions require write access to pull requests,
which means they need the `pull-requests: write` permission.

For workflows triggered by pull requests from forks
(common in open-source projects),
be careful about what information you expose in comments,
as fork contributors can trigger these workflows.
Never expose secrets or sensitive information in PR comments.

See @sec-ai-best-practices for more guidance on workflow security.
