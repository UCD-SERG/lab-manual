When you encounter a coding problem,
creating a **reprex** (minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample)
is one of the most effective ways to get help—and
often helps you solve the problem yourself.

A good reprex [@reprex]:

- Is **reproducible**: Contains all necessary code, including `library()` calls and data
- Is **minimal**: Strips away everything not directly related to your problem
- Uses small, simple example data (often built-in datasets)

**Why create a reprex:**

- 80% of the time, creating a reprex helps you discover the solution yourself
- 20% of the time, you'll have a clear example that makes it easy for others to help you
- It respects others' time by making your problem easy to understand and reproduce
