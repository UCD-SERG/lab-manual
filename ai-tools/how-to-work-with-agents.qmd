GitHub Copilot coding agents can be used in several ways to automate development tasks:

#### Assigning Issues to Copilot

You can assign GitHub Issues directly to `@copilot` just like you would assign to a human collaborator:

1. **On GitHub.com**:
   Navigate to an issue and assign it to Copilot in the assignees section

2. **In VS Code**:
   In the GitHub Pull Requests or Issues view,
   right-click an issue and select "Assign to Copilot"

3. **From Copilot Chat**:
   Delegate tasks to Copilot directly from the chat interface in supported editors

#### The Agent Workflow

Once assigned an issue,
the coding agent follows an autonomous workflow:

1. **Analysis**:
   Reviews the issue description,
   related discussions,
   repository instructions,
   and codebase context

2. **Planning**:
   Determines what changes are needed and creates a work plan

3. **Development**:
   Works in an isolated GitHub Actions environment,
   modifies code,
   runs tests and linters,
   and validates changes

4. **Pull Request Creation**:
   Creates a draft pull request with implemented changes,
   audit logs,
   and a summary of modifications

5. **Review and Iteration**:
   You review the PR and can request changes;
   the agent will iterate based on your feedback

#### Example: This Document

This very section you're reading was created through the coding agent workflow:

1. **Issue created**: [Issue #42](https://github.com/UCD-SERG/lab-manual/issues/42) requested adding discussion about benefits and hazards of coding agents,
   including a Matrix film connection and best practices

2. **Agent assigned**: The issue was assigned to `@copilot`

3. **Work completed**: The agent analyzed the requirements,
   reviewed the repository structure,
   and implemented the changes across multiple files

4. **Pull request**: [PR #50](https://github.com/UCD-SERG/lab-manual/pull/50) was created with comprehensive content about coding agents,
   including this "How to Work with Coding Agents" section,
   benefits and hazards discussion,
   best practices,
   and firewall configuration details

5. **Iteration**: The PR received feedback comments requesting additional links,
   improved wording,
   and this example section—all of which the agent addressed through follow-up commits

This demonstrates the full lifecycle of working with a coding agent on a real documentation task.

#### Collaborating with Coding Agents

Between iterations of asking coding agents to extend a PR,
human collaborators can also push changes directly to the PR branch.
This allows for a collaborative workflow where both humans and agents contribute:

- **Human contributions**: You can make quick fixes,
  add content,
  or refine the agent's work by pushing commits to the same branch

- **Agent iterations**: After your changes,
  you can ask the agent to continue working on additional requirements

**Important**: Try to avoid pushing changes while the coding agent is actively working.
Simultaneous edits can produce conflicting diffs that:

- Need to be manually resolved
- May confuse both human and AI collaborators
- Could result in lost work or merge conflicts

**Best practice**: Wait for the agent to complete its current iteration
(indicated by the PR being updated)
before pushing your own changes to the branch.
Then assign new work to the agent for the next iteration.

#### Directly Prompting for Pull Requests

You can also prompt Copilot to create pull requests without first creating an issue:

- Use Copilot Chat in your editor to describe the changes you want
- The agent will analyze your request and create a pull request
- This is useful for quick fixes or well-defined tasks

#### Important Safeguards

- **Human approval required**:
  Coding agents cannot merge their own changes
- **Branch restrictions**:
  Agents can only push to their own branches (e.g., `copilot/*`)
- **Full transparency**:
  All agent actions are logged and visible in the PR
