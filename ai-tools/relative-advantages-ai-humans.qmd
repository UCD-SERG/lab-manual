AI coding agents and human coders have complementary strengths.
Understanding these differences helps you decide when to delegate work to agents
and when to handle tasks yourself.

#### Comparative Strengths: Humans vs. AI Agents

The table below summarizes the relative advantages of human coders
and AI coding agents across different types of tasks:

| Task Type | Humans (Neo/Keanu) 😊 | AI Agents (Agent Smith) 🤖 |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Creative thinking and handling ambiguity** | 😊 Humans excel at understanding context, handling ambiguous requirements, and thinking creatively about novel problems | 😠 AI agents struggle with ambiguous requirements and creative problem-solving in unfamiliar domains |
| **Following instruction scripts precisely** | 😞 Humans make mistakes when following repetitive instructions and may introduce inconsistencies | 😊 AI agents excel at executing well-defined, repetitive tasks with precision and consistency |

This pattern mirrors the evolution of programming itself.
Just as almost no one writes machine code anymore because higher-level languages
and compilers handle those details,
most developers will increasingly spend less time writing low-level code.
Instead,
you'll describe what the system needs to do as clearly as possible,
and AI agents will handle many of the computational and coding details.

For most tasks,
you won't need to step in and manipulate code yourself.
However,
you'll still need strong coding skills to:

- Supervise and validate AI-generated code
- Handle edge cases that agents struggle with
- Make creative decisions about architecture and design
- Understand when agent suggestions are incorrect or suboptimal

#### Future Developments: World Models

As AI technology advances,
the distinction between these strengths may shift.
Yann LeCun,
2019 Turing Award winner and AI researcher at Meta and NYU,
advocates for developing "world models"—AI systems that understand and reason
about the physical world,
not just language patterns [@lecun_world_models].

World models aim to give AI systems:

- **Persistent memory and reasoning**:
  Understanding that persists across interactions
- **Physical world understanding**:
  Reasoning about how things work in reality,
  not just in text
- **Better handling of ambiguity**:
  Using world knowledge to interpret unclear requirements

As these technologies mature,
AI agents may become better at tasks requiring contextual understanding
and creative problem-solving.
This makes it even more important to develop strong supervision
and validation skills now,
so you can effectively work with increasingly capable AI systems.
