Coding agents require specific network access to function properly.
If a coding agent is running behind a corporate firewall or on a restricted network,
you may need to configure allowlists to enable coding agent functionality.

#### Built-in Agent Firewall

Coding agents run in a GitHub Actions environment
with a built-in firewall that limits internet access by default.
This firewall helps protect against:

- Data exfiltration
- Accidental leaks of sensitive information
- Execution of malicious instructions

By default, the agent's firewall allows access to:

- Common OS package repositories (Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc.)
- Popular container registries (Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, AWS ECR, etc.)
- Language-specific package registries (npm, PyPI, Maven, RubyGems, etc.)
- Common certificate authorities for SSL validation

For the complete list of allowed hosts,
see the [Copilot allowlist reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-allowlist-reference).

#### Customizing Agent Firewall Settings

In your repository's "Coding agent" settings page,
you can:

- Add custom hosts to the allowlist (for internal dependencies or additional registries)
- Opt out of the default recommended allowlist for stricter security
- Disable the firewall entirely (not recommended)

If a coding agent's request is blocked by the firewall,
a warning will be added to the pull request or comment,
detailing the blocked address and the command that triggered it.

For more information,
see [Customizing or disabling the firewall for GitHub Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-firewall).
