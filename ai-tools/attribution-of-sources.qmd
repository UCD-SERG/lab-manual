**When using AI tools to generate content that borrows from or adapts existing sources,
you must ensure proper attribution.**
AI tools sometimes paraphrase or adapt content from documentation,
guides,
or other resources without clearly indicating the original source.
It is your responsibility to:

- Ask the AI tool to identify and properly cite sources when it borrows or adapts content
- Verify that any content the AI generates includes appropriate citations
- Add citations yourself if the AI fails to do so
- Follow appropriate attribution practices for the type of content (code comments, documentation, academic writing, etc.)

When instructing AI tools to create documentation or written content,
explicitly request that they provide proper attribution for any borrowed or adapted material.
For example:
"Please quote from and paraphrase [source],
with proper attribution"
rather than simply asking it to summarize information on a topic.
