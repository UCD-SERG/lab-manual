GitHub Copilot coding agents can read Microsoft Word (`.docx`) files, including tracked changes and comments.
This enables a hybrid editing workflow where:

1. Lab members can export Quarto content to Word format for review
2. Reviewers can make edits, add tracked changes, and insert comments in Word
3. Coding agents can read the `.docx` file and translate the edits back to Quarto format

When using this workflow, make sure to explicitly instruct the coding agent to:

- Examine and apply all tracked changes in the `.docx` file
- Read and address all comments in the `.docx` file
- Translate edits from Word formatting to appropriate Quarto/markdown syntax

This approach makes it easier for collaborators who are more comfortable with Word to contribute to the lab manual while maintaining the source files in Quarto format.
