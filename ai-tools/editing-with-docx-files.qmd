GitHub Copilot coding agents can read Microsoft Word (`.docx`) files, including tracked changes and comments.
This enables a hybrid editing workflow where:

1. Lab members can export Quarto content to Word format for review
2. Reviewers can make edits, add tracked changes, and insert comments in Word
3. Coding agents can read the `.docx` file and translate the edits back to Quarto format

When using this workflow, make sure to explicitly instruct the coding agent to:

- Examine and apply all tracked changes in the `.docx` file
- Read and address all comments in the `.docx` file
- Translate edits from Word formatting to appropriate Quarto/markdown syntax

This approach makes it easier for collaborators who are more comfortable with Word to contribute to the lab manual while maintaining the source files in Quarto format.

**Note on DOCX compatibility:**
The lab manual's build process automatically fixes compatibility issues with DOCX files generated by Quarto.
After rendering,
all DOCX files are resaved using LibreOffice in headless mode,
which normalizes the file structure and prevents the "Word found unreadable content" warning that can appear when opening programmatically-generated DOCX files.
This ensures that collaborators can immediately open,
edit,
save comments,
and use tracked changes in the DOCX files without any warnings or errors.
