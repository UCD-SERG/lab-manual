To work with coding agents safely and successfully:

1. **Maintain active supervision**:
   Never assume AI-generated code is correct.
   Review every line critically.

2. **Understand before accepting**:
   If you don't understand what the code does,
   don't use it.
   Take time to learn or ask a colleague.

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   AI-generated code must be tested as rigorously as code you write yourself.
   Don't skip testing because "the AI wrote it."

4. **Start small**:
   Begin with small,
   well-defined tasks to build confidence and understanding
   of the agent's capabilities and limitations.

5. **Verify logic and assumptions**:
   Check that the AI hasn't made incorrect assumptions
   about your data,
   requirements,
   or scientific context.

6. **Review for security**:
   Explicitly check for security issues,
   especially when handling sensitive data or user input.

7. **Iterate and refine**:
   Use coding agents as a starting point,
   not an endpoint.
   Refine and improve the generated code.

8. **Maintain coding practice**:
   Regularly write code yourself to maintain and develop your skills.
   Don't let the agent do everything.

#### Critical: Exercise Extreme Caution with Workflow Files

Be especially careful when allowing coding agents
to edit GitHub Actions workflows or CI/CD configurations.
These files control automated processes that can:

- Access secrets and credentials
- Deploy code to production
- Execute arbitrary commands in your repository

**Never** allow a coding agent to edit workflow files
(especially `.github/workflows/*.yml` or `copilot-setup-step.yml`)
without thorough manual review.
Before approving any workflow run,
always check if the workflow files themselves have been modified.
Malicious or erroneous changes to workflows
can compromise your entire repository and its secrets.
:::

When using coding agents,
work interactively with the AI suggestions:
review,
modify,
and test them rather than accepting them wholesale.
This interactive approach helps ensure code quality
and deepens your understanding of the code.

Remember:
AI tools are assistants,
not replacements for your expertise and judgment.
The quality and correctness of your work remains your responsibility.
