When reviewing a pull request where someone else prompted Copilot to make changes,
follow these guidelines to avoid confusion and ensure smooth collaboration:

**The scenario:**

- One team member (the "prompter") assigned Copilot to work on an issue or explicitly prompted Copilot to start working
- The prompter may or may not be the same person who originally wrote the issue
  - In projects with a user base, users often submit issues (bug reports, feature requests)
  - A project maintainer then steps in, adds their perspective, and assigns the issue to Copilot
  - In this case, the maintainer who assigned Copilot is the prompter, not the original issue author
- Copilot created the PR with the prompter as co-author
- The prompter requested your review
- Copilot may have also automatically reviewed the PR

**As a non-prompter reviewer, your role is to provide feedback,
not to directly initiate more work by Copilot.**
The prompter should remain in control of when and how Copilot makes additional changes.

**Recommended review workflow:**

1. **Use "Comment" or "Request changes" based on the severity of issues**:
   - Use **"Comment"** for suggestions, questions, or minor issues that don't block merging
   - Use **"Request changes"** for significant issues that must be addressed before merging
   - Both options allow you to provide feedback without directly triggering Copilot

2. **Don't ask Copilot to make changes directly**:
   - Avoid using features that would trigger Copilot to start working immediately
   - Let the prompter decide whether to ask Copilot to address your comments or make changes themselves

3. **Write clear, actionable comments**:
   - Explain what needs to change and why
   - Suggest specific solutions when appropriate
   - The prompter will decide how to address your feedback

**For prompters (the person who prompted Copilot):**

After receiving reviews from other team members:

1. **Review all comments carefully**:
   - Decide which comments you agree with
   - Dismiss or respond to comments you don't entirely agree with
   - This ensures Copilot only addresses feedback you've validated

2. **Choose how to address valid feedback**:
   - **Option A**: Make the changes yourself (faster for simple fixes)
   - **Option B**: Ask Copilot to address the feedback (better for complex changes)
   - **Option C**: Add your own review summarizing which comments Copilot should address,
     then ask Copilot to respond to the open comment threads

3. **Maintain clear communication**:
   - Let reviewers know how you plan to address their feedback
   - Mark conversations as resolved after addressing them
   - Request re-review from humans after Copilot makes significant changes

**Transferring the prompter role:**

The original prompter can hand over a PR to another person,
who then becomes the new prompter with control over Copilot's work on that PR.
This might be useful when:

- The original prompter is unavailable or on leave
- Someone with different expertise needs to guide the remaining work
- Responsibilities are being redistributed within the team

To transfer the prompter role:

1. The original prompter should clearly communicate the handover to all reviewers
2. The new prompter should review the PR's history and any open feedback
3. The new prompter should take over responding to Copilot and managing future iterations
4. The team should update PR comments or description to reflect the current prompter if helpful

This workflow ensures the prompter maintains control over the development process
while benefiting from collaborative human review and Copilot's implementation capabilities.
