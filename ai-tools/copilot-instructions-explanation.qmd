The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in this repository
contains specific instructions and guidelines for GitHub Copilot coding agents
when working with the lab manual.
This file helps ensure that AI-generated contributions
follow the lab's formatting standards,
coding conventions,
and documentation practices.

The copilot instructions file specifies:

- Markdown and Quarto formatting rules (e.g., blank lines before lists, line breaks in prose)
- R code style guidelines (e.g., using native pipe `|>`, following tidyverse style)
- File organization patterns (e.g., using Quarto includes for modular content)
- How to work with DOCX files for hybrid editing workflows
- Repository-specific best practices

By having these instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
we ensure that coding agents produce consistent,
high-quality contributions that align with the lab's established practices.
This reduces the review burden and helps maintain consistency
across all contributions to the lab manual,
whether made by humans or AI assistants.

Unfortunately, we can't render the `copilot-instructions.md` file 
as part of this lab manual, 
because it includes dummy
