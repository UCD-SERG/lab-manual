Coding agent sessions are currently^[2026-01-10] considered "premium requests",
which are limited resources;
see <https://github.com/features/copilot/plans> for details.
So,
use coding agents sparingly.
Use them for complex changes that would be difficult or time-consuming
for you to complete by hand.
Coding agents also take time to get configured for work,
every time you make a request.
See <https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment#preinstalling-tools-or-dependencies-in-copilots-environment> for ways to reduce that startup time,
but it will never be 0.
If you can complete the task faster than the coding agent can,
you should probably do it yourself.
For example,
when you have errors in the spell-check or lint workflows,
you can often fix them faster than Copilot can.
Also, when reviewing Copilot's PRs, it's often faster to directly edit the
PR branch than to write clear review comments and ask Copilot to address them.

Also,
the less we practice,
the weaker our skills get,
and the harder it is for us to supervise the agents
and make sure they are actually doing what we want it to do,
the way we want it to do it.
You should exercise your own coding skills regularly,
just like you would for any other skill you want to maintain.
