The `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` file
allows you to customize the development environment
in which the GitHub Copilot coding agent operates.
This file preinstalls tools and dependencies
so that Copilot can build, test, and lint your code more reliably.

#### Why Configure the Environment?

While Copilot can discover and install dependencies through trial and error,
this can be slow and unreliable.
Additionally, Copilot may be unable to access private dependencies.
Preconfiguring the environment ensures:

- Faster agent startup and execution
- More reliable builds and tests
- Access to private or authenticated dependencies
- Consistent development environment across all agent sessions

#### File Location and Structure

The workflow file must be located at
`.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`
in your repository's **default branch**.
It follows GitHub Actions workflow syntax
but must contain a single job named `copilot-setup-steps`.

#### Basic Configuration Example

See [Appendix: Copilot Setup Steps File](#sec-appendix-copilot-setup-steps) for the configuration used in this repository
(adapted for R and Quarto projects).

#### Using `actions/checkout`

The [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action
is used to check out your repository code
so that the workflow can access it.
While Copilot will automatically check out your repository if you don't include this step,
explicitly including it allows you to configure important options.

**Basic checkout:**

```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

**Checkout with full git history:**

```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
```

The `fetch-depth` option controls how much git history is fetched:

- `fetch-depth: 1` (default): Shallow clone with only the latest commit
- `fetch-depth: 0`: Full clone with complete git history and all branches

Using `fetch-depth: 0` is particularly useful for coding agents because:

- **Multi-branch visibility**: Agents can see and compare multiple branches,
  making it easier to understand context when working on features or bug fixes
- **Git operations**: Enables full git operations like rebasing,
  cherry-picking, and examining commit history
- **Diff comparison**: Allows comparing changes across branches or commits,
  which is helpful when reviewing or merging work
- **Better context**: Provides agents with the full repository history
  to understand how code evolved over time

For repositories with large histories,
this increases checkout time and disk usage,
but the benefits for agent functionality usually outweigh these costs.

#### Configurable Options

You can customize only these specific settings
in the `copilot-setup-steps` job:

- `steps`: Setup commands and actions to run
- `permissions`: Access permissions (typically `contents: read`)
- `runs-on`: Runner type (Ubuntu x64 Linux only)
- `services`: Database or service containers
- `snapshot`: Save environment state
- `timeout-minutes`: Maximum 59 minutes

All other workflow settings are ignored by Copilot.

#### Common Setup Tasks

**For Node.js/TypeScript projects:**

```yaml
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: "20"
    cache: "npm"

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
```

**For Python projects:**

```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: "3.11"

- name: Install dependencies
  run: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For R projects:**

```yaml
- name: Set up R
  uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
  with:
    r-version: 'release'

- name: Install R dependencies
  uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
```

#### Environment Variables and Secrets

To set environment variables for Copilot:

1. Navigate to your repository's **Settings**
2. Go to **Environments**
3. Select or create the `copilot` environment
4. Add environment variables or secrets as needed

Use secrets for sensitive values like API keys or passwords.

#### Testing Your Configuration

The workflow runs automatically when you modify
`copilot-setup-steps.yml`,
allowing you to validate changes in pull requests.
You can also manually trigger the workflow
from the repository's **Actions** tab.

Setup logs appear in the agent session logs
when Copilot starts working.
If a step fails,
Copilot will skip remaining steps
and begin working with the current environment state.

#### Advanced Configuration

**Larger runners:**
For projects requiring more resources,
you can use larger GitHub-hosted runners:

```yaml
jobs:
  copilot-setup-steps:
    runs-on: ubuntu-4-core
```

**Self-hosted runners (ARC):**
For access to internal resources or private registries,
use Actions Runner Controller (ARC) self-hosted runners:

```yaml
jobs:
  copilot-setup-steps:
    runs-on: arc-scale-set-name
```

Note: When using self-hosted runners,
you must disable Copilot's integrated firewall
in repository settings and configure
appropriate network security controls.

**Git Large File Storage (LFS):**
If your repository uses Git LFS:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    lfs: true
```
