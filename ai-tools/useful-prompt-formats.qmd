When working with coding agents,
using clear and specific prompts helps achieve better results.
Here are some useful prompt formats that you can use when requesting assistance from coding agents:

#### Common Task Patterns

**Tidying up code:**

- "tidy up [file, function, module, whole project]"
- Useful for improving code organization, consistency, and readability
- Example: "tidy up the data processing module"

**Addressing failing workflows:**

- "address failing workflows"
- Helps fix continuous integration (CI) failures, build errors, or test failures
- Example: "address failing workflows in the GitHub Actions pipeline"

**Decomposing code:**

- "decompose [function, quarto-file, etc]"
- Breaks down large or complex code into smaller, more manageable pieces
- Example: "decompose this analysis function into separate helper functions"

**Updating content:**

- "update [links, content, etc]"
- Refreshes outdated information, fixes broken links, or modernizes code
- Example: "update all package URLs in the documentation"

**Expanding documentation:**

- "expand [a section in a document]"
- Adds more detail, examples, or explanation to existing content
- Example: "expand the section on data validation with practical examples"

**Condensing content:**

- "condense [a section in a document]"
- Reduces verbosity while preserving essential information
- Example: "condense the installation instructions to be more concise"

**Clarifying content:**

- "clarify [a section in a document]"
- Improves clarity, removes ambiguity, or simplifies complex explanations
- Example: "clarify the explanation of the analysis workflow"

#### Tips for Effective Prompts

- **Be specific**: Include file names, function names, or specific sections when possible
- **Provide context**: Explain what you want to achieve and why
- **Set boundaries**: Specify what should or shouldn't change
- **Request validation**: Ask the agent to test or verify its changes when appropriate
