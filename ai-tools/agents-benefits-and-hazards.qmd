Coding agents are powerful programs that can work autonomously.
They create pull requests that propose changes to the code in our repositories,
potentially including their own configuration files and our automated workflows.
They can work powerfully on our behalf,
but they require careful oversight and control to ensure they serve our interests
and that we understand the consequences of their actions.

Coding agents offer several advantages:

- **Built-in transparency**:
Coding agents create a clear record of their role in your work through commit history and code suggestions

- **Context-aware suggestions**:
Coding agents understand your codebase and can make contextually relevant suggestions

- **Integration with version control**:
Using coding agents within GitHub ensures that AI-assisted changes are tracked alongside all other code changes

- **Interactive workflow**:
Coding agents' interactive nature encourages you to review and modify suggestions rather than blindly accepting them

- **Accelerated development**:
Coding agents can help you write boilerplate code, refactor existing code, and implement common patterns more quickly

- **Learning opportunities**:
Coding agents can suggest approaches or techniques you may not have considered, helping you expand your coding knowledge

However, coding agents also come with significant hazards:

- **Over-reliance**:
Depending too heavily on coding agents can atrophy your coding skills and understanding

- **Subtle bugs**:
AI-generated code may contain logic errors that are not immediately obvious

- **Security vulnerabilities**:
Coding agents may introduce insecure patterns or fail to follow security best practices

- **Inappropriate solutions**:
AI may suggest solutions that work but are not optimal for your specific research context or constraints

- **Hidden biases**:
Coding agents may perpetuate coding patterns or approaches that reflect biases in their training data

- **False confidence**:
Well-formatted, professional-looking code from AI can mask underlying problems and reduce critical review

- **Workflow manipulation risks**:
Coding agents that modify CI/CD workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) or setup configurations can inadvertently or maliciously compromise repository security, expose secrets, or execute harmful commands
