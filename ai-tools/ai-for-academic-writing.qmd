When using AI tools to help develop journal articles and other academic writing,
you must take special care to ensure transparency,
maintain intellectual ownership,
and avoid plagiarism.
The following practices help achieve these goals.

#### Establish a Clear Track Record

**Working with AI through GitHub creates valuable documentation
of your contributions versus the AI's.**
This track record can be crucial if reviewers or editors
question your use of AI tools.

GitHub Pull Requests and Issues provide:

- **Attribution clarity**: Each commit shows exactly who (you or `@copilot`) made which changes
- **Audit trail**: The full conversation history shows your instructions and the AI's responses
- **Intellectual ownership**: Your prompts and guidance demonstrate that the core ideas are yours
- **Transparency**: Reviewers can see that you actively supervised and validated all AI contributions

This transparency protects you if journal reviewers are skeptical
about or opposed to AI use in research.
You can point to the PR history to demonstrate
that you maintained control and responsibility for the work.

#### Write Out Your Core Ideas in Prompts

**Make your prompts explicit and detailed to establish
that the ideas originate from you, not from the AI.**

When requesting AI assistance with academic writing:

- State your research question, hypothesis, or argument clearly
- Outline the structure and key points you want to make
- Specify the evidence or data you want to include
- Describe the logic connecting your points
- Explain the interpretation or conclusions you want to draw

**Example of a good prompt:**

> I need help writing the discussion section for a study
> on social determinants of health.
> My core argument is that [your specific argument].
> The key findings I want to discuss are: [list findings].
> I want to interpret these findings as suggesting [your interpretation].
> Please help me draft this section while preserving these core ideas
> and citing relevant literature.

This approach creates clear evidence that the intellectual content
came from you,
while the AI helped with expression, organization, and literature integration.

**Avoid vague prompts** like "write a discussion section about my results"
that give the AI too much creative control
and make it unclear whose ideas are being presented.

#### Request Explicit Source Attribution

**Always instruct AI tools to identify and cite their sources
to prevent unknowing plagiarism.**

AI language models are trained on vast amounts of text,
including published research.
While they don't have direct access to their training data during generation,
they may produce text that closely resembles or paraphrases existing work
without providing attribution.
This creates a plagiarism risk.

**Best practices:**

- Explicitly ask the AI to cite sources for any borrowed or adapted content
- Request that the AI indicate when it is drawing from specific works
- Verify that generated text includes proper citations
- Add citations yourself if the AI fails to provide them
- Cross-check AI-generated content against the cited sources to ensure accuracy

**Example request:**

> Please help me write this section,
> and explicitly cite any sources you draw from or adapt.
> If you're paraphrasing from specific papers,
> identify them clearly so I can verify the citations.

Remember that even with these precautions,
you must still verify the accuracy and appropriateness
of any AI-generated citations,
as AI tools can sometimes generate plausible-but-incorrect references
("hallucinate" citations).

#### Example Workflow

The development of this documentation section demonstrates these practices:

1. **Core ideas stated clearly**: The request outlined specific concepts (transparency through GitHub, writing explicit prompts, requesting source attribution)
2. **Detailed instructions**: The guidance specified what content should be created and how it should be structured
3. **Transparent record**: The development history shows what was human-directed versus AI-generated
4. **Demonstrated accountability**: The pull request provides a full audit trail of all changes

When developing content for journal articles,
a similar workflow creates documentation that demonstrates
responsible AI use and intellectual ownership.
You can point to your GitHub history to show reviewers
that you directed the AI rather than simply accepting its output.

#### Additional Considerations

When using AI for academic writing,
also remember to:

- **Disclose AI use**: Follow journal policies on acknowledging AI assistance (see @sec-ai-disclosure)
- **Maintain responsibility**: You are accountable for all content, including AI-generated text
- **Verify accuracy**: Always fact-check AI-generated claims and citations
- **Preserve your voice**: Ensure the writing reflects your thinking and style, not just AI's patterns
- **Follow ethical guidelines**: Comply with your institution's and journals' policies on AI use

These practices help you benefit from AI assistance
while maintaining the integrity,
originality,
and credibility of your academic work.
