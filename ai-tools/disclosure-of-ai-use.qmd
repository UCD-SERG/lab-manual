**You must clearly state whenever you have used AI tools in your work.**
This is essential for transparency and reproducibility.
Specifically:

- In code comments, note when AI tools were used to generate or significantly modify code
- In commit messages, mention if AI tools assisted with the changes
- In manuscripts and reports, acknowledge AI tool usage in the methods or acknowledgments section
- In presentations, disclose AI assistance when relevant

Example code comment:

```
# The following function was generated with assistance from GitHub Copilot
# and has been reviewed and tested to ensure correctness
```
