**Lab Recommendation:**
For most lab work,
enable **Claude Sonnet 4.5** as your default model.
It provides excellent balance of capability and speed.
Consider switching to **Claude Opus 4.5** for complex architectural decisions or difficult debugging sessions.
Keep **Claude Haiku 4.5** enabled for quick inline completions.
