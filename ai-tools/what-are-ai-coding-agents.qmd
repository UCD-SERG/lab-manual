AI coding agents are [AI agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_agent) specialized for coding.
They differ from other AI coding tools in important ways:

**Compared to inline coding assistants** (like traditional autocomplete),
coding agents work autonomously rather than providing suggestions as you type.
They can navigate entire codebases,
execute commands,
and complete multi-step tasks without constant human guidance.

**Compared to AI chatbots** (like ChatGPT or Claude),
coding agents don't just generate code snippets in conversation—they actively interact with your development environment.
While chatbots require you to copy code from a chat window and manually integrate it into your project,
coding agents directly read your codebase,
make changes to files,
run tests and build commands,
and create pull requests with their proposed changes.
Chatbots are conversational assistants;
coding agents are autonomous development tools.

Coding agents are autonomous software programs that can:

- **Understand and execute complex tasks**:
  Coding agents can interpret natural language instructions and break them down into actionable development tasks
- **Navigate and modify codebases**:
  They can read, understand, and edit multiple files across a repository to implement features or fix bugs
- **Run tools and commands**:
  Coding agents can execute build commands, run tests, use linters, and interact with development tools
- **Make decisions autonomously**:
  They can plan their approach, make technical decisions, and adjust their strategy based on results
- **Work iteratively**:
  Coding agents can test their changes, identify issues, and refine their solutions through multiple iterations
- **Create comprehensive solutions**:
  They can implement complete features that span multiple files, including code, tests, and documentation

Coding agents operate in isolated environments where they can safely experiment and validate changes before proposing them.
This allows them to work more independently than inline coding assistants,
which require step-by-step human direction.
The agent workflow typically involves analyzing requirements,
planning an implementation,
making changes,
testing those changes,
and creating a pull request with the results.

While coding agents can handle substantial development tasks,
they still require human oversight and review.
The human developer remains responsible for:

- Reviewing the agent's work
- Ensuring the solution meets requirements
- Verifying code quality and security
- Making the final decision to merge changes
