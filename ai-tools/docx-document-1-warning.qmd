#### Known Issue: "Document 1" Warning in Word

When you open the DOCX file downloaded from this repository,
Microsoft Word may display a warning message and open the file with the title "Document 1" instead of the actual filename.
Word may also require you to save the file before you can add comments or track changes.

**This is a known limitation** with how Quarto generates DOCX files for books.
The issue is being tracked in the Quarto project:

- [Quarto CLI Issue #6357](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/6357)
- [Quarto Discussion #6544](https://github.com/orgs/quarto-dev/discussions/6544)
- [Quarto CLI Issue #10587](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10587)

**Workaround:**
If you are the author generating the DOCX file from Quarto,
open the generated DOCX file in Word and immediately re-save it before sharing with collaborators.
This one-time step ensures that when collaborators open the file,
they won't see the "Document 1" warning and can immediately add comments and track changes without issues.

**Why this happens:**
The DOCX files generated by Quarto for books may lack certain internal metadata properties that Word expects,
causing Word to treat the file as a new unsaved document rather than an existing file.
