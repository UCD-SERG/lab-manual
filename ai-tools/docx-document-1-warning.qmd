#### Known Issue: "Document 1" Warning in Word

When opening DOCX files generated by Quarto (including this lab manual),
Microsoft Word may display a warning message and open the file with the title "Document 1" instead of the actual filename.
Word may also require you to save the file before you can add comments or track changes.

**This is a known limitation** with how Quarto generates DOCX files.
The issue is being tracked in the Quarto project:

- [Quarto CLI Issue #6357](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/6357)
- [Quarto Discussion #6544](https://github.com/orgs/quarto-dev/discussions/6544)
- [Quarto CLI Issue #10587](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/10587)

**Workaround:**
If you are the author generating the DOCX file from Quarto,
follow these steps before sharing with collaborators:

1. Open the generated DOCX file in Microsoft Word
2. Immediately save the file (File → Save, or Ctrl+S/Cmd+S)
3. Close and re-open the file to verify it no longer shows "Document 1"
4. Share this saved version with collaborators

This one-time step ensures that when collaborators open the file,
they won't see the "Document 1" warning and can immediately add comments and track changes without issues.
