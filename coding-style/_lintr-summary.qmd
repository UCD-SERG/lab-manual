Linters are programming tools that check adherence to a given style, syntax errors, and possible semantic issues. 
The R linter, called `lintr`, can be found in this [package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lintr/versions/1.0.3). 
It helps keep files consistent across different authors and even different organizations. 
For example, it notifies you if you have unused variables, global variables with no visible binding, not enough or superfluous whitespace, and improper use of parentheses or brackets. 
A list of its other purposes can be found [in this link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/readme/README.html#available-linters), 
and most guidelines are based on [Hadley Wickham’s R Style Guide](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html).

::: {.callout-note}
You can customize your settings to set defaults or to exclude files. More details can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/readme/README.html#project-configuration).

::: {.callout-note}
The `lintr` package goes hand in hand with the `styler` package. The styler can be used to automatically fix the problems that the lintr catches.

### `lintr` package

For checking code style without modifying files:

```r
# Install lintr
install.packages("lintr")

# Lint the entire package
lintr::lint_package()

# Lint a specific file
lintr::lint("R/my_function.R")
```

The linter checks for:

- Unused variables
- Improper whitespace
- Line length issues
- Style guide violations

You can customize linting rules by creating a `.lintr` or `lintr.R` file in your project root.
