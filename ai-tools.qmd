# Working with AI

[AI-powered coding assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-assisted_software_development) 
can dramatically accelerate and improve your work,
but they require careful and responsible use.
Lab members who use AI tools must adhere to the following guidelines:

## Responsibility for validation

**You are fully responsible for checking and validating all AI-generated code and content.**
AI tools can make mistakes,
generate insecure code,
produce incorrect logic,
or suggest approaches that are inappropriate for our specific research context.
Before using any AI-generated code:

- Carefully review the code to ensure you understand what it does
- Test the code thoroughly to verify it works as expected
- Verify that the logic is appropriate for your specific use case
- Check that the code follows our lab's coding standards and best practices
- Ensure the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities or data privacy issues

Never blindly copy and paste AI-generated code without understanding it.
If you don't understand what the AI has suggested,
take the time to learn or ask a colleague for help.

## Disclosure of AI use

**You must clearly state whenever you have used AI tools in your work.**
This is essential for transparency and reproducibility.
Specifically:

- In code comments, note when AI tools were used to generate or significantly modify code
- In commit messages, mention if AI tools assisted with the changes
- In manuscripts and reports, acknowledge AI tool usage in the methods or acknowledgments section
- In presentations, disclose AI assistance when relevant

Example code comment:

```
# The following function was generated with assistance from GitHub Copilot
# and has been reviewed and tested to ensure correctness
```

## Attribution of sources

**When using AI tools to generate content that borrows from or adapts existing sources,
you must ensure proper attribution.**
AI tools sometimes paraphrase or adapt content from documentation,
guides,
or other resources without clearly indicating the original source.
It is your responsibility to:

- Ask the AI tool to identify and properly cite sources when it borrows or adapts content
- Verify that any content the AI generates includes appropriate citations
- Add citations yourself if the AI fails to do so
- Follow appropriate attribution practices for the type of content (code comments, documentation, academic writing, etc.)

When instructing AI tools to create documentation or written content,
explicitly request that they provide proper attribution for any borrowed or adapted material.
For example:
"Please quote from and paraphrase [source],
with proper attribution"
rather than simply asking it to summarize information on a topic.

## Coding Agents

We recommend working with **[AI coding agents](https://github.com/features/copilot/agents)** 
to [help you code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-assisted_software_development).

### What are AI coding agents?

AI coding agents are [AI agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_agent) specialized for coding.
They differ from other AI coding tools in important ways:

**Compared to inline coding assistants** (like traditional autocomplete),
coding agents work autonomously rather than providing suggestions as you type.
They can navigate entire codebases,
execute commands,
and complete multi-step tasks without constant human guidance.

**Compared to AI chatbots** (like ChatGPT or Claude),
coding agents don't just generate code snippets in conversation—they actively interact with your development environment.
While chatbots require you to copy code from a chat window and manually integrate it into your project,
coding agents directly read your codebase,
make changes to files,
run tests and build commands,
and create pull requests with their proposed changes.
Chatbots are conversational assistants;
coding agents are autonomous development tools.

Coding agents are autonomous software programs that can:

- **Understand and execute complex tasks**:
  Coding agents can interpret natural language instructions and break them down into actionable development tasks
- **Navigate and modify codebases**:
  They can read, understand, and edit multiple files across a repository to implement features or fix bugs
- **Run tools and commands**:
  Coding agents can execute build commands, run tests, use linters, and interact with development tools
- **Make decisions autonomously**:
  They can plan their approach, make technical decisions, and adjust their strategy based on results
- **Work iteratively**:
  Coding agents can test their changes, identify issues, and refine their solutions through multiple iterations
- **Create comprehensive solutions**:
  They can implement complete features that span multiple files, including code, tests, and documentation

Coding agents operate in isolated environments where they can safely experiment and validate changes before proposing them.
This allows them to work more independently than inline coding assistants,
which require step-by-step human direction.
The agent workflow typically involves analyzing requirements,
planning an implementation,
making changes,
testing those changes,
and creating a pull request with the results.

While coding agents can handle substantial development tasks,
they still require human oversight and review.
The human developer remains responsible for:

- Reviewing the agent's work
- Ensuring the solution meets requirements
- Verifying code quality and security
- Making the final decision to merge changes

### When to use a coding agent

Coding agent sessions are currently^[2026-01-10] considered "premium requests",
which are limited resources;
see <https://github.com/features/copilot/plans> for details.
So,
use coding agents sparingly.
Use them for complex changes that would be difficult or time-consuming
for you to complete by hand.
Coding agents also take time to get configured for work,
every time you make a request.
See <https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment#preinstalling-tools-or-dependencies-in-copilots-environment> for ways to reduce that startup time,
but it will never be 0.
If you can complete the task faster than the coding agent can,
you should probably do it yourself.

Also,
the less we practice,
the weaker our skills get,
and the harder it is for us to supervise the agents
and make sure they are actually doing what we want it to do,
the way we want it to do it.
You should exercise your own coding skills regularly,
just like you would for any other skill you want to maintain.

### Editing with `.docx` files

GitHub Copilot coding agents can read Microsoft Word (`.docx`) files, including tracked changes and comments.
This enables a hybrid editing workflow where:

1. Lab members can export Quarto content to Word format for review
2. Reviewers can make edits, add tracked changes, and insert comments in Word
3. Coding agents can read the `.docx` file and translate the edits back to Quarto format

When using this workflow, make sure to explicitly instruct the coding agent to:

- Examine and apply all tracked changes in the `.docx` file
- Read and address all comments in the `.docx` file
- Translate edits from Word formatting to appropriate Quarto/markdown syntax

This approach makes it easier for collaborators who are more comfortable with Word to contribute to the lab manual while maintaining the source files in Quarto format.
