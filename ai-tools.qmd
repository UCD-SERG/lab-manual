# Working with AI

[AI-powered coding assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-assisted_software_development) 
can dramatically accelerate and improve your work,
but they require careful and responsible use.
Lab members who use AI tools must adhere to the following guidelines:

## Responsibility for validation

{{< include ai-tools/responsibility-for-validation.qmd >}}

## Disclosure of AI use

{{< include ai-tools/disclosure-of-ai-use.qmd >}}

## Attribution of sources

{{< include ai-tools/attribution-of-sources.qmd >}}

## Coding Agents

We recommend working with **[AI coding agents](https://github.com/features/copilot/agents)** 
to [help you code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-assisted_software_development).
